Okay.
Okay.
Well what do you think about the idea of, uh, kids having to do public service work for a year?
Do you think it's a
Well, I, I think it's a pretty good idea.
I think they should either do that, or, or afford some time to the military, or, or helping elderly people.
Yes,
yes,
I, I, you know, I think that we have a bunch of elderly folks in the country that could use some help
and I think that before we expend all our young talent overseas and, and helping other countries we ought to perhaps give a little bit of our help to our own folks at home
and I'm not sure that that's not a bad idea
That's true.
and, or the military for a year or two, wouldn't be bad for,
Yeah.
I think it teaches kids how to grow.
How about yourself?
Uh, I agree with you.
Uh, uh, what I'm thinking about is back well, when I was a kid, and much earlier than that, kids were kind of,
you know, the parents kind of pushed them to join, like the Boy Scouts or Girl Scouts
and they did, do, do do a lot of public service activities,
but these days they're not, uh,
parents aren't encouraging their kids to do things like that.
Because when I was in the Girl Scouts, we did a lot of public service things, because that's just part of, of the scouting, and, you know.
Yeah,
I've, I've,
that's really great.
I, I really think that both the Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts is a excellent, two excellent organizations.
They are
but parents,
You know, kids seem like when they get ten or twelve years old they fall out of that,
Yeah,
they do.
and they don't follow it at all, you know.
There are very few Scouts go on, and become Eagle Scouts.
Oh, no.
And, and I don't know what the high rank is for the gals
but,
I, I, uh,
senior.
Oh.
Senior,
okay.
So, there's not, uh,
Oh, they're just not,
once they get into junior high it just, not done anymore
Yeah,
they, they lose interest.
and then when they young, young adults, there's even less interest there.
Uh-huh.
They're more for, I
Me
Not, not,
yeah.
Grab,
grab,
grab,
walk out
Yeah,
you're absolutely right
Yeah
I think it's a really a good thing.
I, I like to see,
of course, there's, you know, third world countries that can use all kind of help
Yeah,
but there's a lot that can be done right here in this country, too.
But I think, we ought to start right here at home.
I'm, you know,
Yeah,
uh, I'm not, I'm not so sure that overseas help, helping overseas would be such a hot idea for, for, uh, a lot of young people.
No,
it, it,
But, since there is much that needs to be done here.
I think that, yeah, I think that we need to really address what we've done here
and, and then perhaps even a six month tour overseas that gives them much broader outlook.
Uh-huh.
Well, it's been really good.
We talked about this for a few minutes,
and, uh, hopefully, we'll have other good topic maybe another call someday,
but I, I don't really have too much more to say on this topic, I guess.
No,
I, I agree with you
It, we, I guess we both agree that it's a good thing, that they should do sometime.
Yeah.
Okay.
Well you take care,
and, and, enjoy the day.
You, too.
You, too.
Thank you, ma'am.
Bye-bye.
Bye-bye.
