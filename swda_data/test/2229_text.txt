Do are you on a regular exercise program right now?
Yes,
and I hate it
How about you?
Oh, well, I'm kind of off and on.
Off and on
well, I guess I've been kind of off and on
I've, uh, Had some health problems that have led me to, uh,
Right now I'm kind of off.
I'd say more on than off
Okay,
what type of exercise do you do?
Uh, I do walking on the treadmill,
and then I do low impact aerobics.
Okay.
I guess you don't enjoy that very much.
Not, not really.
Do you find that, uh, to be boring?
Yeah,
and time consuming,
I mean it's not just the exercise that's boring and time consuming,
it's, uh, you know, afterwards, you know,
then you have to take a shower and get cleaned up, you know.
Yeah.
Well, I'm trying to get back in shape for softball this spring.
Oh, yeah.
But I,
Do you go through this, is this something that you go through every year
Yeah,
I haven't decided whether, whether I want to play yet or not
I just bought myself a solo flex machine,
I don't know if you've seen those advertised on T V.
Uh-huh.
It's one of those, uh, universal type machines, exercise machines.
But I haven't really sat down and used it match yet,
so it's collecting dust right now.
Yeah,
a lot of things do that.
I had an, I had an exercise bike
I used to jog somewhat.
I use to have one,
and I finally got rid of sit cause I never used it,
but I do use my treadmill
Uh-huh,
well, that's good.
Yeah,
my parents have a treadmill
it's,
when I go visit them, uh, I get on that thing every now and then.
Yeah,
it's nice because when the weather's bad you can't, you don't have any excuse.
Uh-huh,
I just got the bicycle out today,
and it was real nice outside,
had to get out to do something.
Yeah,
I can't ride a bike
so.
I've been sitting in here in the house all weekend with a cold
so thought I, better, better get outside and do something and not waist the day.
Oh.
Yeah,
it's too nice,
it's been too nice all weekend.
But, uh, yeah,
I need to start jog something again.
I've always of that to be, uh, really one of the best forms of exercise,
but it's terribly boring,
and so I really don't ever keep a program up consistently.
Have you ever had any injuries from jogging?
No,
I never have.
Well, I don't job enough I think to develop any injuries
I usually only go about a mile or two.
I guess it worries me about jogging it's that I hear that it's very hard on your body and, and that, you know, you can end up getting hurt, worse.
Yeah,
it's, it's tough on the joints if you jog on concrete, or on asphalt.
Uh-huh.
Suppose to be much better if you find grass, uh, or, or dirt to jog on.
Yeah,
that's not quite so so easy.
You have to have the right, type of shoes too,
that's, very important.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I found that, true especially from walking on toe and fronts .
But,
Yeah,
I don't have to buy jogging shoes all to often
my don't get very much use
Well, I guess my breakdown about, they say about every six months.
Uh-huh.
I usually enjoy the exercise I do
but, uh, like I said I'm just not very consistent about maintaining a, a program.
So I'll, I'll bicycle
I get into that for, for a little while and maybe go out, uh, on a consistent basis every couple of days and ride a bike for awhile,
but then I'll get tired of doing that, and maybe start jogging again and go out about three or four nights a week.
But, uh, that gets old too in a very short order,
Yeah.
I'm, I'm hoping that this, uh, solo flex will, uh, uh, change things a little bit,
I really need to get on a regular type of program and use that thing on a consistent basis.
Yeah,
well, don't let it collect dust.
At least exercise while dusting it off
Yeah.
well.
Maybe if I can get interested in playing softball again this string I can, uh, start some type of, uh, regular program.
Yeah,
that, that'll be good.
I've always found that, uh, when you write things down and set goals it's a lot easier to keep, uh, keep something going.
Uh-huh.
Uh, when I was in high school we had a choice of, uh, taking, uh, physical education courses on exercise,
an, uh, one of those involved a six weeks session on a universal machine, lifting weights and, uh, working out like that.
Oh.
And that was very helpful
we kept charts of our progress, and, uh, consistently increased the empty of resistance so you could see how much you improved over the weeks.
Uh-huh.
I found that to be, uh, very helpful.
Are you going to do that?
Uh, I need to,
I haven't started yet
but, uh, it's a thought.
Well, that sounds like something good to do then.
Sounds like something I should do.
Yeah,
nice way to start off this spring. Get back in shape.
How often do you, uh, uh, go out each week on your walking?
Well, I do,
I switch every other day
one day I walk
and one day I do the aerobics.
Okay,
how far, about how far do you go walking?
Well, I'm trying to get my tolerance now
I just had surgery, um, less then two months ago,
and right now I'm just a little over about a mile and a half,
Okay.
but I'm trying to workup to three miles.
Well, that's good.
Well they say that walking is just as good if not better then jogging.
Yeah,
It,
it takes, it's just that it takes longer to get to the same effect.
Sure.
Yeah,
but.
Well, if you keep up with a consistent pace just to, uh, keep the heart rating going, uh,
My walkman broke,
Yeah.
so I'm upset
and I just have to turn to stereo up real loud
Yeah.
But it's a lot less stressful on the joints then jogging is.
Yeah,
it is
and this doesn't, you know,
my treadmill has an incline
and, you know, you can get a really good workout on it.
Um, do you go to an aerobics class
or do you watch, on T V?
No,
I, I just do it on T V,
Okay.
I have a cassette.
Which, uh, shows do you watch on T V?
Um, it's a, it's a
I use tapes.
Oh, okay,
okay,
like a Cathy Smith workout,
Or, or Richard Simmons,
or Jane Fonda.
Okay
Sweating to the oldies
Right.
I, every now and then I'll watch E S P N,
I get cable on T V,
Uh-huh.
and they have, uh, a couple of shows called basic training,
and, uh, what is the other one called.
There was one guy I use to watch on E S P N,
I don't know if he's still on any more or not,
I I don't know if I get E S P N or not
Uh-huh.
But, uh, one, you know,
I use to watch one, watch one on the air,
but that was back,
BODIES IN MOTION that's, that's the name of the one I was thinking of. With Gill.
That's was,
yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah,
I watched that cause he was cute
Yeah,
he's not bad
his assistants usually aren't either.
But, uh,
They're always in, in Hawaii some place. On, on the beach.
Yeah,
yeah.
But then that was back when, uh, you know, the high impact and,
Yeah,
well, they, they do low I pact stuff now,
Do they.
Are
yeah
they're still, they're still, he's still doing it then, uh.
Yeah,
every morning.
I'll have to tune in.
It's on E S P N, uh,
at what time,
I can't remember what time.
It's, uh, you know,
I can't remember offhand what time.
I'll have to check it, check, check, check it back up,
Yeah
and, but the thing is everybody always looks so good on that show, at least on
Yeah,
every now and then.
Not everybody has a picture perfect body.
Uh-huh,
well, I found that they, they have just a much better program than the other shows that are on T V.
I haven't watch any other ones on T V. watch=watched Just on some of the tapes.
They're on weekdays at eleven o'clock every day. Monday through Friday incase you're interested in that.
Okay,
thanks.
but, uh, I haven't done so much as, uh, watch the tape that I made.
Now, that's a thought.
So I'm kind of bad about that myself.
Well, that's thought,
I haven't thought about that,
well they're going to beep us pretty soon.
Okay,
well, I sure enjoyed, to you about exercise and fitness.
Nice talking to you too.
Okay,
thanks.
So, all right.
Talk to you later.
Good night.
Bye.
Bye.
