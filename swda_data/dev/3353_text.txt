Um, tell me some about your camping experiences, Carolyn.
Well, um, I have gone to girl's camp a few times, as a, you know, a chaperon or a leader, whatever
Okay. where do you go camping at around here?
and, uh, I enjoy camping.
I,
we we have a tent,
and we've gone, even with our family a few times out camping and have a camp stove, um,
I guess our, our, my biggest memory is when we froze to death
We just didn't take enough blankets and whatever.
Uh, we went camping at, uh, Lake Bonham, which is, is pretty close here. Um,
we went fairly early in the season for this area, which is probably April is when we went,
Okay.
and, and it got really cold at night,
and of course we were close enough that we could go back and get some more blankets and things in the morning,
Sure.
but,
Uh, what, uh, what activities do you do when you're camping?
Oh, we take little nature hikes
and, and, uh, we take along games that we can play with the, with the kids, and just that kind of stuff.
Usually try to have a, uh, occasionally a camp fire at night, you know, and roast the marshmallows and what all.
Uh-huh.
Well, that sounds like fun.
I, uh, I grew up in South Dakota, up in the Black Hills
Oh.
and so we used to go camping,
my dad would take us,
there was, there was four of us kids,
we'd, he'd take us,
and we'd all go camping, my dad and my mom and, and the kids,
and it was always fun, uh,
because what I always remember is, my dad would let us pick our camp spot
and, uh, he'd always tell us, you know, okay, look for, you know, a nice flat little area where we can pitch our tents,
and it always had to be somewhere near a, a river so we could go fishing,
and hopefully we'd catch our supper,
but we never did
Um.
but it was, it was always fun.
We'd always,
Mom was always prepared
and she'd bring along, you know, something, because tradition had it we would never catch anything,
so we always had, something along to eat,
but then we'd roast, roast marshmallows,
and it, it was always an enjoyable experience.
Uh, about nineteen eighty-two I moved from Rapid City in the Black Hills,
I crossed the state to, to Aberdeen,
and, uh, there's no hills,
it's flat,
and then I was in high school,
and, uh, couple of friends, couple of my high school friends and I, we'd go camping out by a river, of course, and, and go fishing,
but by then, of course, I was able to catch, uh, catch some things,
but, it, it was always fun.
It was a different experience camping in the hills versus camping just by a river
Uh-huh.
you know, in the hills we, we would do like you you folks did, you folks did, would take the nature hikes and, you know, and look for animals,
and we always, you know,
in the hills, you can see quite a few different animals,
but,
Uh,
Go ahead.
We used to live in Utah
Okay.
and, uh, of course, there's lots of mountains around there to camp in, and, and streams and stuff.
That's, that's a great place to go camping,
and the hiking is just really great.
You know, hike up those mountains is just really fantastic. Um.
Sure.
Now is there anything, uh, are there any mountains or big rocks a person could hike around this area.
I'm not acquainted with any, you know,
I,
there's woods and things out in East Texas Tyler area, you know,
Okay.
there's a Tyler State Park that's, uh, really a nice camping area,
but it, it's just a lot of trees,
it's not,
I don't know of any place in Texas that has, uh, really big, you know, what I call mountains
Uh-huh.
I,
The Rocky Mountains are so much, uh, bigger than anything that they've they've got down here that,
Right.
Is the one in Tyler, has it been pretty commercialized, I suppose?
No,
it's not, well, it's not too bad.
They have, um, screened in areas, you know,
they're not really cabins, I wouldn't say,
I guess they could call them that, but they're, they're more just a screened in, uh, camping area whatever,
Okay.
they're, they're not bad.
Helps, helps keep the, the pests out, I suppose.
Yeah,
yeah
Well, that sounds,
I don't know if I can rate camping,
but, you know, it sure beats driving a thousand miles, to to find a mountain, I guess.
Yeah,
that's right.
I, I take it you haven't done a whole lot of camping in this area.
No,
we just moved down in, in June.
Oh, I see.
Well, you're still, uh, you're just trying to get over the culture shock still
Yeah,
I'm still trying to find my way around.
I, if I can get on Central from anywhere, I'm happy.
Yeah.
Yeah,
well, really the ideal times to camp in this area are early spring, and, in, in the fall.
Okay.
It just gets so hot in the summer you can hardly,
I mean, there's, there's a lot,
