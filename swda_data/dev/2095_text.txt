All right, have you lived in this area long?
No,
I've only been here a couple of years.
Okay.
Uh, but, uh, I've, I've noticed that, uh, this year it seems to have been a lot warmer than it has in the past.
Yeah,
it, it, it's, it's a lot warmer, a lot drier too, because usually about this time of year, this, you know, you see a little bit more rain.
I mean by, by mid February, I mean, we start getting a lot of rain.
Yeah,
yeah,
well I remember last year, or the year before, uh, we had ice and snow, uh, uh,
But it,
terrible ice storm, uh, around this time of the year.
Uh-huh.
And, uh, this year it's been so hot and, uh, sunny
it, it's really quite, uh, quite amazing.
Yeah,
unseasonable.
I used to, my wife and I we used to live in San Antonio, couple years ago,
Uh-huh.
and it was, it was I remember the first day of Spring,
it was so much ice that came down, later on that that afternoon and evening,
Um. Yes,
it was just, it was horrible.
I was just talking to my son today,
he's up in Boston,
and it was twenty-nine there
and it was, you know, in the seventies out here
and, it was really, uh,
Yeah.
he really wished he could be here, rather than there.
Yeah,
well, um, I don't know
I, I guess I'm just sort of acclimated to colder weather.
Oh really.
Um, I, I like it warmer,
I mean I like it, you know, I like it warm
but it doesn't really matter.
I mean, I'd, I would much rather see it cool at this time of year anyway because it would mean a little bit more rain possibly
but, uh,
Uh-huh,
uh-huh.
I have, you know,
I, I,
I think it's really been delightful.
I come, uh, I've spent most of my time in, in warm weather areas
and, uh, uh, the ice and snow just doesn't, uh, hold any allure for me at all.
Well I spent three years in Germany,
so I'm not too thrilled with the whole thing anyway
But I got used to it,
it was really strange,
I mean, when I, when, when, when we came to San Antonio it was just like, uh, you know, it just, just swelter
and then we got used to it
and then we went up to Dallas
and it was just,
it's, it's not, not that it's just hot or dry,
it's just not very comfortable,
it just,
do you, you think San Antonio is more comfortable than Dallas.
Yeah,
a little bit.
Uh-huh.
Yeah.
You must, well, uh,
it must be quite a bit hotter down there, isn't it?
Yeah,
my wife and I, the last day we were in Florida, we, my visiting my, uh, my parents, and my brother and sister,
we were, we were down there
and, the last day, right before we left, we had to, I had to ride with my sister
and the air conditioning went out on the car
Oh, wow.
and, we, you, you just get used to air conditioning all the time,
Oh yes.
and this,
it was just,
the humidity was like eighty plus, eighty percent plus
and it was just killing us.
Oh yeah,
it's terrible.
Orlando is the only place I've ever been where I've seen the car sweat.
Yeah.
I mean, that's really bad.
Yeah,
well, I mean, I, I, I guess I've been in some places, you know, where the weather was just so mild, you know, places like Monterey, California or, you know,
Uh-huh,
uh-huh.
just, you know, so mild,
and then you've been to such extremes like San Angelo, Texas where you just, where you walk outside and you sweat,
you know you're sweating,
Yeah.
you look down at your arm,
but you see the water leaving your arm,
it's so hot, you just feel it pulling away, bizarre.
Oh wow, uh.
I know I, I tend to, I tend to be able to get along with monotony in the weather when it's very temperate.
Yeah.
Uh it doesn't,
some people say, uh, they, they like to watch the changing of the seasons
but, uh, I'd rather, you know, like southern California, you know, have it kind of sunny and temperate all the time.
Yeah.
So, it's kind of a luxury.
I tend to agree
but, I don't know,
I, I think, in, in some, in some respects it probably more tolerable.
Yeah,
well I guess this, the weather isn't as lively a topic as, uh, as some of the others we might have gotten.
No,
the other topics.
I got one topic,
they said talk about the Middle East well,
I guess we're supposed to say good-bye or something, and think about what
my daughter is here prodding me to say good-bye.
We messed up the conversation, anyway.
Well I mean I've had some pretty bad, I guess some pretty controversial topics
so it's just like well that was my fault.
But then the weather's like,
man, I mean, it gets pretty mundane,
I mean you can only talk about, about the situation just so long.
Yeah,
I know,
weather's just not all that inspiring.
Okay,
well it's nice talking to you.
Okay.
Bye-bye.
Bye.
