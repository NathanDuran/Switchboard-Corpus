Okay.
The topic is to discuss the, uh, sources where I receive news.
Uh-huh.
And, uh, for me that's mostly newspaper and radio,
I almost never watch television, as a matter of course
so, I don't get news from television,
except during the war, I watched a lot of C N N because it was so good.
Uh-huh.
Well, why was C N N the only,
of course I think, Saddam Hussein only allowed C N N to broadcast it,
is that not true?
Um.
It was unusual not to have the different sources, you know, of news coverage.
Yeah.
Um, I don't know.
I guess, uh, I don't even know why I watched C N N.
I guess, I just wanted more news.
It's one of the few times I wanted more news than.
Yeah,
well, I know even if you watched A B C, N B C or the other,
I mean, what's the other one, uh,  C B S.
C B S.
They all were, were tapped into C N N.
Were they?
Uh-uh.
Yeah.
That's the only thing they broadcast
and like you I listened to radio on my job at work.
Uh-huh.
And all this week they have been having this, uh, a discussion about that is why, uh, why C N N was
well, I listen to a Christian radio station.
Uh-huh.
And they were saying that C N N is definitely a world, uh, news service
and, uh, they,
it was,
you can't really be sure of the quality of what you've got, you know.
Huh.
Uh, we had some, uh, some people from our church went to Israel, uh, just for a, uh, tour sort of thing.
Uh-huh.
And I was watching on TV
they, they broadcast this terrible riot
supposedly that was going on in Jerusalem,
Right.
and so it really made me question as to what, how do we know, you know, uh, if the news we're getting is any good.
So
Yeah,
I guess, the news just focuses on major events that probably, don't affect ninety-nine percent of the people who are right there when the news is being made.
Yeah.
Right,
right.
But, uh, I, I'm from California
and I can remember being in, uh, in these earthquakes
and, I mean they were, they were very minor kinds of things from my point of view, and it seemed, you know, from anyone else's point of view,
Yeah.
but they get all blown up in the news. Um,
Uh-huh
Well I, I find it depressing to watch our,
specially TV, you know,
it's just, uh,
local news concentrates, on murders and things like that.
I'm from Dallas
and, uh, we have a lot of bad stuff, uh,
it just really gets me depressed, even to watch it.
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
Yeah.
So then, you wake up one morning
and you are in war with somebody
you don't even, even know about it.
Right.
So.
Well, what newspapers, uh, do you read in Dallas?
Uh, we have the DALLAS TIMES HERALD and the DALLAS MORNING NEWS,
but I don't, I don't read newspapers
Don't you?
Huh-uh.
How come?
Uh-huh.
I find it hard to, uh, follow from one page to another.
It's just something I have never developed, uh, an interest in.
Huh.
And I live in kind of a bad area where if I have the paper delivered it's stolen before I can get out and get it
Gosh that's, that sounds pretty bad to me.
I mean who would steal a newspaper?
You would be surprised.
Huh?
They just come by and pick them up even if it's just for the TV, you know uh, selections of the day.
I see.
I don't know.
It just wouldn't be there whenever I tried it.
Yeah.
So, you're right,
who would steal a newspaper?
in glass sound in But, they do.
Yeah.
What part of California are you from?
Uh, from Los Angeles,
but I live in Raleigh, North Carolina, right now,
that's where I am speaking to you from.
Oh, okay.
But, I grew up in L A.
I work out here.
Huh, you work for T I?
No,
I don't.
I work for North Carolina State University.
Huh.
But, uh, I know some people at T I,
and I have a couple of students who have graduated and gone to work for them.
Yeah.
So, I'm in the computer business.
Well, I,
boy, current events is not a good subject for me.
Well.
I don't keep up with it that often.
Let's see, I've, I've, I've never done this before,
I mean I've never.
This is your first call?
This is my first call. Because I just got my password.
Oh, really.
Yeah.
So I don't know,
are we suppose to,
it seems to me it says you are suppose to talk for three minutes,
but I think we've been talking for three minutes
and nobody has interrupted.
Yeah,
well I, I got into a conversation last night with a lady
and they interrupt at ten, minutes.
I see.
So if we've done our three minutes. Let's just let the conversation end and say bye.
Uh-huh.
Well, all right.
Nice talking to you.
Nice talking to you too.
All right,
bye.
Bye-bye.
