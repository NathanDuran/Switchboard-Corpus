Okay Karen.
you're first.
Okay.
I was just going to say I think one of the biggest thing for me is room for advancement. You know, not to get in, like in a dead end job.
Uh-huh.
And plus, for me, it's, uh, I mean like medical and you know, uh, benefits and dental.
Okay.
They're also important.
Yeah.
I guess one of the differences I see is, uh, working for a university, uh, there is room for advancement, but not so much so, our in, uh, quite a highly unionized environment and then also in the administrative association
Um.
so there is a progressive path,
but not being in the say the commercial sector, the motivation isn't there for a lot of people uh, like  really,
Um.
Are they  like pretty much train for a specific job
and that what I hired for and then I, just very little variation from that.
Yeah,
somewhat that,
but then also there just isn't the ability to in one sense have, uh, a broader scope for rewarding people for their performances.
Uh-huh.
Uh, so that's in our situation where we are dealing with an institution,
uh, it's a little more difficult to recognize an individual's performance
Uh-huh.
and I suppose that's maybe a disadvantage of being in a larger institution, perhaps somewhat even with the business, uh.
But I agree, you know, the, uh, medical benefits and those kinds of things are one of the big pluses of working for a large organization and also the, uh, security aspect for long term employment, uh,
Well, you know that's interesting though.
Because I don't know if that's necessarily the case anymore.
I use to think that, you know, after you work,
you mean security, job security?
Job security,
yes.
Uh, that use to be I think a couple of years ago,
but I don't know if it is so much anymore.
In fact, they, we just had a lay off in what November, I guess.
Uh-huh.
But, uh, it wasn't necessarily,
I mean, you know, some people had been there a long time.
Yeah,
we are seeing that here as well.
Like in some of the large oil companies. There has been massive lay offs.
Uh-huh.
Uh, so I, I think there it's probably a major distinction between institutions and the corporate world in, uh, institutions are slower to react both on the growth side and then also on the reduction side where the businesses, we need to cut back, that's what we do.
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
No  doubt
But,
yeah.
Yeah,
and institutionally, like here at the university, oh if there is a cut back, well gee, it's not where it necessarily where it's needed,
it's where it's most expedient which, Well, in one sense for us, it's where it makes the least noise which means  it's  often the lowest support type roles.
Expedient,
yeah
that's exactly it.
Yeah,
where the most dollar, where, where you know it cuts back the most.
Oh.
Oh.
See, yeah.
So we,
Yeah.
I think that's one of the things too.
You get too many management people, you know.
It's very easy.
Yeah
and it's very easy for them to say, oh this is the best way when they really aren't aware of what all it took to get the work done you know.
Yeah.
And then they wonder why it doesn't get done in the same amount of time.
Well, those people aren't there anymore.
Right.
Because it's support people that are  providing  the speed for it.
Yeah.
Uh-huh.
Yeah,
but,
so what else do you think is important?
Well the, uh,
that's maybe the majority of the importance, I guess.
Yeah,
because my perspective is from an institution,
uh, the, there is not much incentive for innovativeness because the limitation for reward is very severe
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
but if you're in the corporate world, I think there is considerable motivation for I guess innovation,
although he, you know, the more complex your structure the, uh, less difficult it is to kind of carry some things through
Uh-huh.
but, uh, I think there is, uh, it's a long term type of process where in a small organization it's, uh, things can happen much more quickly
and so you can see the reward of the efforts.
I think probably in a small,
yeah,
I was going to say more, it's more personal for one thing.
You probably have a better team, uh, cooperation, or team playing, atmosphere.
Right.
Probably, where as in a bigger corporation, I think you're just a number, you know.
Yeah.
You end up being your own person
Uh-huh.
and, uh, if you do your job fine and if somebody else is messing it up, well then that's their problem
and you  know you really,
Uh-huh.
whereas  yeah in a smaller,
I think you would be more willing to either help that person or help it get accomplished, you know.
Yeah.
Yeah.
It becomes the organization instead of person being you know a part of the individual themselves.
Uh-huh.
