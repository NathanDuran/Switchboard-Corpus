Okay, um.
How has it been this week for you?
Weather-wise, or otherwise?
Weather-wise.
Weather-wise.
Damp, cold, warm
Oh, no,
damp.
We have, we have gone through, what might be called the four seasons, uh, in the last week.
Uh-huh.
We have had highs of seventy-two, lows in the twenties.
My goodness.
Well, I don't even want to tell you what ours has been like then.
It was ninety-six yesterday,
I heard about that.
and we set a record yesterday. And, uh, very windy,
but then today the wind has dropped off, and also, the temperature, so, very cool, uh,
I think right now it's like sixty-nine,
Um
and that's cool for
or it feels cool compared to yesterday, but very pleasant,
no rain in the last month, I don't think.
The ground's very dry
and our yard work, everything is in bloom,
so our yard work is pretty tough, the ground being dry,
but I guess it also, uh, brings about allergies,
we're having a lot of allergies down here right now.
Uh-huh.
Everything blooming,
and, and the weather.
Uh-huh.
And, uh, I think a lot of people have contracted, uh, spring fever too,
so. Had a lot of people out at work, you know, for fishing, and, and uh, and golfing, reasons and things like that.
The blue flu,
Yeah.
yeah,
the blue flu, or the white collar flu, depending on where you work, I guess.
Yes.
Oh, we have had, uh, as I've said, we have had variable weather. Uh,
Um.
It has been untypically wet for this time of year,
Um.
and, also, we have a lot of green, you know,
the grass has been growing
and if you look outside, you would like to go out and mow your lawn, if you could go out and buy a new spark plug, or something along those lines,
Uh.
but fortunately it rains
and you, uh, do not have to go out and buy the spark plug, you know.
Yeah.
But, we've had an unusually, uh, uh, warm spring,
and, well I guess we're still in winter,
and, uh, we have had no snow.
Uh-huh.
No snow?
To speak of, to speak of.
Um.
We usually average, oh, anywhere from six to twelve inches during the winter
and this year, as well as last year, we have had less than four inches total accumulation.
Um.
So, it's been inordinately warm, uh, here, for, uh, for this time of year.
Um.
So, uh, in that regard, it's fine,
but, uh, I envy you your ninety-four degrees.
Uh-huh.
I thought I heard this morning that in San Antonio it was in the nineties yesterday.
Yes,
yes
it is.
Down in the more southern and western areas.
And, of course we are, um, about two hours from the northern border, straight south,
Yeah.
and, and, uh, very windy.
It's amazing to me
because I have only lived in Dallas for three years,
and I cannot believe that the wind blows all the time.
It does,
I, I
very seldom, if any,
I can't remember, you know, a day that I walked out and the wind wasn't blowing.
Uh-huh
Well, I spent six years in graduate school at, in Indiana. In the flatlands,
and it was that way every day.
Um.
Rarely a day went by when the wind was less than fifteen or twenty miles an hour. Summer and winter,
Um.
so, that, uh,
you, you became accustomed to it, I guess.
Uh-huh.
But, uh, otherwise as I said, we have had, uh, a relatively mild winter, speaking for this area of the country.
Uh-huh.
Oh, where did you go to school in Indiana?
Purdue.
Purdue.
I have a brother that lives in, uh, uh, South Bend, Indiana.
Oh, yes.
And, I had to always,
I've lived there for eight years myself.
I'd always said I was going to go back to school and go to Notre Dame.
But, I didn't. Uh.
Well, you are not from that area originally, I can tell.
No,
originally I'm from New Mexico.
Oh, okay.
I was born in New Mexico
and we lived in, uh, South Bend for eighty, eight years, and, uh, then moved to, uh, Tennessee actually.
Uh-huh.
And, uh,
Well, I thought I heard a little Tennessee in there somewhere.
Very much,
very much,
cause I, I spent thirteen years there. And, uh, then moved to Dallas about three years ago.
Uh-huh.
So,
Gee,
you've moved almost, moved around as much as I have
Yeah, uh,
my father was in the Air Force,
so,
Oh, I see.
Uh-huh.
Well, I worked for the government,
so I, I moved, uh, much more frequently than I had intended for sixteen years,
Uh-huh.
but, uh, I guess the, uh, this is my first conversation in this, uh, uh, series.
Oh, uh-huh.
I, I received a call last night because of the, uh,
I had not received my, uh, personal identification number.
Right.
So, I had to call Jack Godfrey today to ask him what it was, because I, I had to abort the call last evening because I couldn't get on the line.
Yeah
So, uh, is there any,
I'm not sure how long we're supposed to talk.
It's, um, it's just as long as you want to.
Oh.
I mean it's just, uh, as long as you want to, and just, you know, a reasonable lengthy conversation.
Uh, do you work for Texas Instruments?
No,
I do not.
I work for G T E.
Oh, okay.
And, I, uh, of course, was, I was sent a, uh, an application from, uh, from Jack.
Uh-huh.
I've known Jack for some time.
I'm in the speech processing business, and have been for a number of years,
Oh, okay.
so I was very much interested, in, in being a speaker for this
Yeah.
Well, actually, I, I work for Texas Instruments,
and, uh, I'm an a, I'm an environmental engineer,
Oh, I see.
and, uh, they just published this internally, you know, getting people involved.
Uh-huh.
So, that, that's really strange.
I, I was wondering why we had somebody from Maryland though.
I was saying, God, do we have a TI in Maryland
or,
I'm sure you have a representative somewhere in the area. If just nothing more than a business representative or government services representative,
Uh-huh.
and, um, but I have, uh, I have been a speaker in other, uh, similar type of activities.
Uh-huh.
And, I know the reason why this is, why the, uh, this is being gathered and the program and so forth,
so, I was interested as I said, I was interested in being a speaker.
Uh-huh.
We haven't talked much about the weather
Oh, well.
I know that's what we're supposed to do.
Yeah,
yeah.
Well, really it, uh, the letter just says, um,
let's see, I can't,
I was looking at it,
I was trying to find out speedy short cuts,
and I always thought it's not necessary to measure your time, just to go ahead and enjoy the conversation, and, and, end it when needed.
So.
Uh-huh.
In environmental engineering, uh,
Uh-huh.
is that with regard to work place engineering, or just, you know, the work place environment
or,
Uh, well, it's actually, um, waste water.
Oh, I see.
Taking, taking care of uh,
I'm actually in the air division,
and we monitor, um, anything that comes out of a stack, or out of a building,
or, um, we do have customers that, um, their concerns are in the work place
and we take care of that,
but , within our department. We take care of everything. Waste water, uh, solid waste, and recycling, and, and air and
Uh-huh.
Well, I had
my, the, the call last evening was supposed to be about, uh, concerning recycling in the community.
Oh, uh-huh.
The call I received,
and so, I had, uh, I had thought a little bit about it, um, before hand.
Uh-huh.
Oh, uh-huh.
So, I,
but that, that's interesting.
I have a, uh, uh, friend who is a planner. Uh, a city planner.
Oh, uh-huh.
And, one of his,
and he models, uh, city districts, and so forth, uh, does computer modeling.
Uh-huh.
Yeah.
And, one of the, uh,
he has inputs, or gets inputs from, uh, an environmental engineer. .
Uh-huh.
Yeah,
we actually, our division is corporate wide,
and we take care of just the Dallas area.
Uh-huh.
Of course we have several plants here,
but, um, we do air modeling also.
Oh, I see.
And, and, yeah, I take care of all the air modeling, specifically for the Dallas area.
What we do, we have a weather station, that we get all of this information, you know, temperature, wind speed, wind direction,
and, uh, we have a huge chemical data base.
Well, that's interesting.
And, uh, our, our chemical data base, so that we know every chemical on site
and, and, um, its concentration,
and if, if anything ever happened, God forbid, you know, a building explosion or something we'd be able to track chemicals from that building with our weather station.
