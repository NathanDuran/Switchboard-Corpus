So the general topic is hobbies.
Yes.
Let's hear about your hobbies.
Well, let's see,
what kind of hobbies do I have?
I guess, uh, I, it's more not so much a hobby but things I enjoy doing.
I enjoy playing basketball and, and basically all kinds of sports.
And, uh,
Any handicrafts?
Excuse me.
Any handicrafts?
No,
not, not really, um,
no,
I'm really not too creative
well, I, uh, you know, around with my hands and things like that
I leave that more up to my Mom
So, um, I think I'm in handicraft.
Oh, yeah.
I think it will become resume writing.
Oh, well, let's hope that you, you aren't employed by that craft for too long.
Uh, yeah,
I, I hate to think about it
and, and I'm getting rather good at reading want ads.
Uh-huh.
Yeah,
it, it,
what kind of time frame is it, uh, looking for the, uh, different shifts up there?
I
who knows.
Is it, uh,
basically, I had read that they're just looking at relocating them all to McKinney is it, Texas,
No,
all means about fifteen to twenty percent,  of, of,  oh,
Oh, wow.
I'm sure the number's somewhere classified
but some of the internal news and the news services,
so, it's approximately six fifty,
Uh-huh.
so  ten percent of six fifty, is sixty-five
and twenty percent would be one thirty.
Wow,
how about that.
Yeah,
that's what it did report was a hundred and thirty relocating down to McKinney.
Yeah,
that's possible.
How about that.
Well, that's, uh, that's unfortunate
is there many other,
are you in the defense?
Oh, yes, .
Is it, uh, many other corporations in the area?
Uh, I saw Seven Eleven that was hiring.
Well, I'm sure with the new, uh, contract awarding
I, I think it went to Lockheed, didn't it?
Yes.
That, uh, I hear they're hiring all over the place for that.
Yeah, uh,
no,
Apple's coming to town
and,  and that  has some opportunities
Oh, really?
and, uh, and,
Now is that ad good just to Colorado or to Colorado Springs?
Colorado Springs specifically,
yes.
How about that.
And, uh, and, uh, M C I coming if, if, telemarketing is your bag.
Uh-huh.
Personally I'd rather die a slow painful death
but,
Well, you in the, uh, computer operations or in the actual, uh, manufacturing?
Uh, I'm a defense worker.
I'm, government tool control specialist.
Right,
yeah,
that's why I was in the Deseg down here in Plano also.
Are you still employed?
Am I still employed by T I,
no,
I took a leave of, of T I back in November.
Oh.
Actually, December was my first month away from them.
Exempt or ?
Exempt.
Oh, yes.
It, uh, unfortunately I guess for myself it wasn't, uh, it was purely by my own choice.
It wasn't, uh, there was no incentive for myself to leave,
but it was just an opportunity arose
and decided to take it.
Oh, so, you didn't even get the severance package.
No.
I should have taken the, the, the, you know, uh, option when that was there,
but it was just, I missed it by a couple months.
But, you know, what can one do.
I'm just happy still to have a job.
So, are you happy with what you are doing now?
Yeah,
I am kind of happy with it,
it's getting better all the time,
I knew it would be different from the very beginning,
but, you know, as you get to know more of the people that work there and more of what's going on with the system,
so I was in the computer operations
it's, uh, you know, it all starts to become similar
there's, you know, there's benefits
and there's things that weren't as good,
Yeah.
but  as an overall package, I'd say I'm pretty happy so far with the way it's turned out.
Good,
good.
Well, it hasn't been a long time T I
or I,  I'm  significantly shaken by the situation,  but  not devastated.
Uh-huh.
Right.
Uh-huh.
Well, the one thing I guess at least in your favor is the, the fact that, that is more in the support of the manufacturing
and there's lots and lots of companies that have maybe not in the the defense area but manufacturing in general.
To tell you the truth, I'm, I'm, I'm not really worried.
Uh-huh.
That's great.
That's good.
And, and I seem rather happy about it most of the time,  just,  just to know, what's, possibilities are,  you know,  what might happen.
Uh-huh.
Sure,
yeah.
Sometimes it's good just to have everything out on the table.
But still in all,  it feels funny.
It may be a blessing in disguise.
I know a number of people who are, uh, surplused
and they're just,
actually, what the positions that they found outside of the company were much, much better than the ones that they currently had inside.
So, despite the fact that I should be tying flies or fly fishing or, or going for walks in the mountains,  I  can't seem to get into it right now.
Exactly.
Uh-huh,
well, I'm sure it's just with the, the, the, the way that things are so topsy-turvy right now as soon as you decide on a pass ,
Uh, situational.
I've, I doubt I'll be here in six months.
Uh-huh.
Well, would you like to be there?
I,
all things being equal, yes.
Uh-huh.
But, or, or even somewhere better,
Sure.
but,  God this is much better than west Texas.
Uh-huh
Well, just take the day,
But then they, they tell me Hell is much better than west Texas.
Well, actually, uh, the, the Plano, Dallas, Houston, you know, Austin that whole area is, is actually quite, quite nice.
I, my little brother lives in Austin right now.
Oh, that's a beautiful place.
Goes to U T.
Uh-huh.
That's just fantastic down there.
Take it more as a,
this is your opportunity to do whatever you want,
pick out where you want to live,
and then once you pick that spot out, pick out what you want to do.
I see that's the problem.
For the last many years I've more or less let them direct what I want to do,  and  where I want to go. And just kind of go with the punches.
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
Sure.
And now I feel lost.
Uh-huh.
Yeah,
that's a,
it, it takes a bit of a shift doesn't it.
Oh, I had job offers.
Uh-huh.
But, I never found the one that was worth it for me to leave.
And that,
Uh-huh.
Well, the best thing about it is that you can, uh, try something
if you don't like it, shoot, move on to something else.
That's the way I would have looked at the whole thing here,
I'll take a chance,
if I don't like it, I'll go someplace else, do something different.
Oh so, had you been with T I long when you changed?
Five years.
Yeah.
I've been with them sixteen.
Yeah,
I can imagine, you know, the longer and longer it goes,
Actually, seventeen now,
and, oh, yeah,
momentum is, uh, driving force in our lives.
Uh-huh.
But so, yeah,
I'm looking as, as a opportunity.
Well, that's good,
you've got a good attitude about it.
And, and I'm looking at it as a change.
Uh-huh.
And I'm looking at it as, as an adventure.
Right,
there you go.
That's the way to do it.
And maybe I'll wet a fly line this year and do some camping if I don't get laid off between now and then.
There you go,
that's the thing to do.
That's much funner than doing any kind of job.
Ha, how about we end this?
That will work out just fine.
Nice talking to you.
All right,
nice talking to you.
Bye.
Good-bye.
