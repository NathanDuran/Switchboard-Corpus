B|I bet it was.|ba
A|Uh|%
B|The last time we went to Cafe Pacific, it was Father's Day,|sd
B|and we took another friend with us|sd
A|Oh.|b
B|and, uh, for dessert we thought we had just stuffed ourselves|sd
B|And so we had, they had, uh, like a berry assortment.|sd
B|It was, it was raspberries and blueberries and, and strawberries on a plate with like a custard on the bottom.|sd
A|Oh.|b
B|And, you know, they did, like the raspberry puree, just kind of like in a, in a decoration on the,|sd
B|you know, how they do the plates real fancy with the decorations and then piled the berries and shaved chocolate on top of it|sd
A|Yes.|b
A|Yeah|b
A|Oh.|b
B|and it was outstanding.|sd
A|It sounds wonderful.|ba
B|It was really, really relatively simple|sd
B|but, oh, it was good.|sd
B|It was really good.|sd
A|Well, that's, uh, one of the things that I do enjoy when you get a good restaurant.|sd
A|Uh, I love fresh berries.|sd
A|And, their, their fruits are always exceptional.|sd

A|they must have a special source for getting them because even at the Farmer's Market, uh,  you can't find them like that|sd
B|You can't find them.|^2

B|You know, I'm originally from Connecticut|sd
B|and, uh, I was home a few years ago|sd
B|and my sister and brother-in-law were going to take us out for dinner|sd
B|and, uh, I was really amazed, you know,|sd
B|the, the restaurants up there were kind of quaint.|sd
B|You know, they were real, real pretty|sd
B|but they lacked, the service|sd
B|and they lacked the the, just the, I don't know.|sd
B|The restaurants down here seem like they have, uh,|sd
B|I guess there's so much competition that they, really have to be good.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And, I thought I would really miss that.|sd
A|I would, too,|aa
A|because, well, because we don't go out very often.|sd
A|When we do go out, um, in a way it's like a little mini vacation I guess,|sd
A|and, uh, it is, it's a whole experience.|sd
A|Of course you want the food to be good|sv
A|but the atmosphere and service I think, are important, uh too.|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|And, you know, in order to survive in this area I think they have to be good.|sv
A|Yeah.|b
B|Because the ones that aren't so good don't, just don't make it.|sd
A|Um, that reminded me of a place for lunch that's a little off the beaten track|sd
A|but it is wonderful.|sd
A|It's called Cafe Max|sd
A|and it's at Plano Road and Campbell.|sd
A|They have the most wonderful salads.|sd
A|They do what they call a salad sampler which easily could feed two or three.|sd
B|Oh, really?|bh
