Okay,
do you subscribe to magazines yourself?
I don't, uh, subscribe to any magazines at home, because we get so many at work that, uh, I need to read that, uh, I just don't take any at home.
Oh, I see.
I get, uh, MCCALL'S.
Of course, anything that appeals to the homemaker since that's my main line of interest.
Uh-huh.
And then once in a while I'll pick up a WORKING WOMAN or something and realize why I don't want to go back to work What I enjoy about staying home.
Uh-huh.
Right.
And, uh, I read magazines mainly because they're fast
and if I want to relax while I watch T V,
of course, I'm one of those that does two things at once,
and, uh, I read GOOD HOUSEKEEPING and BETTER HOMES and MCCALL'S.
And I like them because they're kind of short and to the subject.
Right.
I I used to take MCCALL'S and GOOD HOUSEKEEPING and, uh, several magazines like that a few years ago at, at, at home.
Uh-huh.
And then you stopped them all.
But, yeah,
the subscriptions ran out
and I never renewed them.
And I found that I really didn't have time at home since I work, to read them.
I find that, uh, about two years is probably my max on subscribing to one in particular
Uh-huh.
and then I kind of get turned off by it. Other than GOOD HOUSEKEEPING.
Uh-huh.
GOOD HOUSEKEEPING is the one that kind of sets around for when, uh, when I'm really have time and I really want to read something, you know.
Uh-huh.
I don't get into books too often because I have so many things that I stay occupied with uh, on a general basis,
Uh-huh.
and we travel a lot
so I enjoy reading parts on travel in the various you know, different ones.
Uh-huh.
Right.
And I get into, uh, newspapers,
so I guess that kind of tells you what kind of person I am.
I'm, read it fast and put it down
Right.
Uh-huh.
When, when I had my magazines at home, I would find that I kind of skimmed through them and looked at the pictures, you know,
and if something caught my eye, then I might read something,
Right.
but otherwise than that, you know, they were, uh, you know, not too useful to me. You know
Well, That's what I do.
I got some good recipes from them sometimes,
but
You clip recipes
and you save them forever
and you never really use them.
Uh-huh.
That's right,
that's right.
And then every so often you weed through them
and you think, where did I ever put that recipe.
Right.
But, uh, that's mainly my, uh, whole idea on you know, short subject, uh, reading and things like this.
Uh-huh.
I, I subscribe, like I said, to a few
and once in a while I buy that new magazine called FIRST on the newsstands or something like that.
Uh-huh.
But I kind of stay with my own subject matter what, uh, pertains to my daily life at the present time.
Right.
Well, since I work with computers during my work, I have to keep up on all the new computer equipment and software and everything.
And I have to read the magazines, you know, such as BYTE, and COMPUTER WORLD and MAC WORLD and all of these, uh, magazines such as that,
so I really, you know, just,
I can see that it will be a very long time, probably, before I subscribe to any magazines at home.
Right.
Well, sometimes, if, you know, if you're in transportation, in public transportation I know that people will read them on something like that.
Uh-huh.
Right.
But I think,
and the idea is to, is and good,
I can just dump them at the other end
and I don't have to carry them back with me.
That's right.
I do that when we travel.
I always have my head with a magazine somewhere as we drive or wherever we,
Uh-huh.
no matter what it is, air travel or anything and I,
Uh-huh.
Right.
If I, if I go on an airplane ride or something, I'll stop in and pick up a, you know, a COSMOPOLITAN or something to read on the airplane.
Right,
although now,
But, uh, you know, that's basically just about
I'll buy a crossword puzzle magazine every now and then
That's when you really have time.
Now see your computer ones,
I got into computer work somewhat, uh,
we have our own computer system at home
Uh-huh.
and I tried, uh, reading the magazines hoping I would get more from it
and it was just above my head without having someone there to give me the advice as I went along.
Uh-huh.
It was, you know, kind of a little bit more than what I needed,
so I never did get into them.
I when I bought the computer, all of a sudden I was receiving them, for some unknown reason, through the mail.
I think they all thought, well, we have a live one She'll subscribe
Uh-huh.
But they were wrong.
I never got into them.
But, but, Okay?
Right.
All right, I guess we might as well end our conversation at this point.
Okay.
It was nice talking with you.
It was nice to talk with you, too.
Okay.
Thank you.
Uh-huh.
Bye, now.
Bye-bye.
