A|Uh, well my husband is French|arp_nd
A|and we were living in France at the time|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and we decided that I, I've never been to Africa|sd
A|and I needed to get that continent since I hadn't been there yet.|sd
A|And it, it's, actually it's a fairly common vacation place for French people to go|sd
A|and they speak French|sd
A|and, so, uh, you know, in that sense is just a little bit easier|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and it just seemed like it would be a fun place to go.|sd
A|And, So we, we didn't really have enough time.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
B|Oh I'm sure it was wonderful.|sv
A|We had about, a little bit less than two weeks.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And as always, it it seems a bit, uh, rushed.|sv
A|We do a lot of traveling around.|sd
A|We rented a car and drove pretty much everywhere.|sd
B|Was it hot?|qy
A|No,|nn
A|in fact some of the days we froze.|sd
A|It was,|%
B|Really?|bh
A|well we were there in the winter. In uh, January or February, I don't remember which,|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|I was born in Saudi Arabia|sd
B|and, uh, when my father worked there we, they used to travel quite a bit, all around you know, in, in Europe and whatnot,|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|but I was very young|sd
B|so I don't remember that|sd
B|and, I was three when we moved back here.|sd

B|So I don't remember|sd
B|but we have all these wonderful pictures of all these great places that they have been|sd
A|Uh-huh|b
B|and that I was when I was a baby|sd
B|but so, Morocco I think would be wonderful|sv
B|because that's, you know, that's, that area of the world I think would be great.|sv
A|Yeah.|b
A|It was a very interesting vacation.|sd
A|The only thing I didn't like was in some of the more touristy areas uh, um, the, it would just be besieged by people wanting to be your guide|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and you, there were some places, where people,|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|there would be kids there that were excellent at ripping you off,|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and we had nothing taken because we knew|sd
A|and we had things in inside pockets and in, you know, in jacket underneath a coat type of thing.|sd
B|Really.|b
A|But,|%
B|We, we found that in Jamaica.|sd
B|It was the same way, that people would come up and try and sell you, well try and sell drugs and things like that|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|but they, they were so destitute|sd
B|and I guess they, they make all their money on tourism|sd
B|and, and they would come up and ask you, you know, if, if you want to buy different things|sd
B|and really, after awhile it really gets annoying,|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|you know, it, it's a little scary too when they're coming up and they're all over you.|sd
A|The, the worst place was in Marrakech|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and the other cities it wasn't nearly as bad|sd
A|and a couple of them it was, what we did in some of the other cities|sd
A|and they tell you to do that is to hire a local guide|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|it doesn't matter who it is|sd
A|and they keep everyone else away from you.|sd
B|Oh really.|b
A|And it's worth it|sv
A|and it's like ten dollars a day or something|sd
A|and its worth it just to keep everyone else away from badgering you|sv
B|Really.|b
A|and you feel stupid doing that|sv
A|but we did it,|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and we were much happier,|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b

B|Now when was that, when were you there?|qw
A|Um, August, eighty-eight.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b

A|I don't think so.|ng
B|I remember food|sd
A|Oh, I like that too.|sd
A|But, uh, in fact I didn't eat out that much there because I was traveling by myself in a car,|sd
A|it would have been, I think, much more fun to do it like in the van, with a bunch of people.|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|But, uh,|%
B|Oh you're adventurous.|ba
B|You went by yourself.|qy^d

A|And I was by myself in China too.|sd
B|Really?|bh
A|Yeah.|ny
B|Oh wow.|ba
A|China was a little bit more, uh, of a challenge.|sd
A|But, it, it wasn't more of a challenge in a sense because I hired a guide all the time,|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and so I never, you know, got out by myself, or not much,|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Was it very expensive?|qy
A|No,|nn

B|You're kidding!|ba
B|No kidding!|ba
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|because I was already in Hong Kong|sd
A|and, um, but it only cost you about a thousand dollars to go there|sd
A|and I went to Beijing, Shanghai, Chengdu|sd
A|and actually then I took a train up from Shanghai to a little, Quingdao I think is the name of it.|sd
A|It's a little, uh, sort of getaway retreat village not far from Shanghai.|sd
A|It's just a train ride.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And that,|%

A|It was really,|%
B|All for a thousand dollars?|qy
A|Uh-huh.|ny

B|Uh-huh.|b

B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Yeah,|aa
B|yeah,|aa
B|and you don't want to stay in the very, very, very exclusive, because you don't really even get a flavor of the country if you're,|sv

B|Wow.|ba
A|Uh, but|%

B|Oh really.|bh
A|Yeah.|ny
A|Uh, and a friend of mine who had gone for a business trip to China|sd
A|and she just gave me this woman's name to contact|sd

B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and then,|%
