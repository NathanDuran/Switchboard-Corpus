A|Oh.|bk
B|I used to, you know.|sd
A|All this planning and, and getting together and such.|qy^d
A|Um, oh, let's see what else.|^h
B|Usually when we have kind of our family reunion it's my grandmother's birthday,|sd

A|Uh-huh.|b
B|so it's a pretty big reunion,|sd
B|it's about two hundred people, maybe.|sd
A|Oh, my word.|ba
A|Well, what did you find was most helpful in planning the birthday get together?|qo
B|Um, the, probably the biggest challenge was getting a place where everyone, you know, could eat comfortably and, and everything, uh.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|bk
B|I guess probably the most helpful thing was that, um, for the rent, we rented like a, a rescue squad building or something like that.|sd
A|Oh.|bk
A|Uh-huh.|bk
B|And, uh, each one of the, everybody that showed up donated some money for the rent and for, for like soft drinks|sd
B|and and so nobody like really got stuck with the bill.|sd
A|Oh.|bk
A|Oh, that's good.|ba
B|And each person in the family, you know, brought a dish, or something.|sd
A|Uh-huh,|bk
A|and then did you have a main meal,|qy
A|or did everyone just bring,|%
A|it was just pot luck.|qy^d
B|It was kind of pot luck.|na
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|You know, everybody brought their specialties, I guess you would say.|sd
A|Yeah,|b
A|yeah,|b

A|Well, I I had a real challenge of planning a family reunion a few years ago,|sd
A|and there were,|%
A|we sent out five hundred, uh, announcements, because our family is quite large, like your, your family there.|sd
A|And so that was a real challenge,|sd
A|and I was president of our family reunion for two years,|sd
A|and I wasn't very at that duty, for two years in a row,|sd
A|but I found that advance planning was the key to success.|sd
B|Uh, also one thing that's helpful,|sv
B|and I don't know if your family's spread out or whatever|qy^d
A|Uh-huh.|ny
B|but most of, all my family lives like in the same county|sd
B|so|%
A|Oh, that's wonderful, though|ba

B|and, it's so and such days from such and such date|^q
A|Oh.|b
B|and everybody just shows up.|sv
A|Oh, well, that is, that is helpful.|aa
A|Yeah,|%
A|our family ranges from, oh, goodness, well, Australia,|sd
A|I have a brother lives in Australia, to, uh, Boise, Idaho, and, and, uh, all kinds of places.|sd
B|I would say you're spread out, then.|sv
A|We are|aa
B|Uh, my immediate family, you know, my, my parents and my brothers and sisters, I guess we're the ones that have the gypsy blood or whatever,|sd
B|because my dad was in the Army|sd
B|and we're we're pretty strung out all over.|sd
A|Oh.|b
B|But since they've moved back to Carolinas, we still are the only ones do not live in in Yantsen County.|sd
A|In.|%
A|Oh.|b

B|and then my, my parents live in Greenville,|sd
B|and I have one brother and his wife live in Greenville, and, uh, another brother that lives in, outside of Fayetteville.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b

B|but everybody else is centralized in, in, my home town, Waynesboro|sd
