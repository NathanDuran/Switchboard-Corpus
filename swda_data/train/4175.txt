A|I don't believe that we're ,|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
B|So what do you think about, uh, recycling programs in Atlanta, Julie?|qo
A|The recycling program here is just terrible.|sd
A|I mean it's hard to find places to go.|sd
A|I mean, Kroger does a couple things.|sd
A|They, I don't think they, do they do newspapers?|qy
B|I don't know,|no
B|there's, there's big bins out there,|sd
B|I don't know if they ever get|sd
B|I, I really don't know what the details are.|sd
B|There should be someplace where you could call and find out.|sd
B|As a matter of fact, I'm pretty sure there's a place you can call and find out the closest, you know, thing to you,|sd
B|but, I think there should be some kind of curbside service.|sv
A|Yeah.|b
B|That's the only way I could really,|sd
A|The one in Florida is so cool because they pick up everything.|sd
A|They pick up newspapers and, uh, you know, milk jugs and aluminum and tin cans, you know, like soup comes in and stuff.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|sd
A|They pick up everything.|sd
B|During the summers, like the, around where I live the, uh, homeless people|sd
B|I mean, they all have like shopping carts and stuff|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and they're go around and collect cans and aluminum and stuff,|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and so we used to just save them up|sd
B|and then they'd come around|sd
B|and we'd give them to them.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|But, when,|%
B|during the winter time I think they, they move south or something|sd
A|Yeah|b
B|so, I don't do that anymore.|sd
B|And the, the recycling at Georgia Tech, like that, uh, outside the, uh, student center they never empty those things.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|sd
A|I know it,|aa
A|I know it.|aa
B|They just overflow.|sd
A|It piles up.|sd
B|So what's a guy to do?|qh
A|I just don't know.|h
B|I asked myself.|h
A|I just don't know|h
A|and now they have, like bins and stuff that are a little more convenient because, mean, until seven o'clock, you got to pay to park at the student center,|sd
A|you can't really unload all your stuff.|sd
B|Really?|bh
B|Huh, oh, yeah,|aa
B|that's true,|aa
B|hadn't thought about that.|sd
B|That is very inconvenient.|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|Inconvenient, even|sv
A|I know it,|aa
A|I know it.|aa
B|But, uh,|%
B|so, you do recycle, don't you?|qy
A|Oh, yeah.|ny
B|Yeah,|b
B|I'm kind of, I'm kind of bad about it.|sd
A|The ,|%
B|If I, if see a, if I see a pile of cans or bottles or something I'll throw it in there|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|but I don't really, I don't ever take anything.|sd
A|Well, I mean, it's real,|%
A|you ought to, because the, the, the farmer's market recycles absolutely everything.|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And since we go there all the time, I mean|sd
B|But wait|^h
A|probably at all.|sd
B|I've never seen you before|sd
B|Who are you?|qw
A|Oh, by the way, may name's Julie.|sd
B|Yeah,|b
B|my name's Bill.|sd
B|Well,|%
A|Hi.|fp
B|Hi.|fp
A|I'm from Atlanta.|sd
B|Me, too.|sd
A|Neat.|ba
B|Crazy.|ba
B|Uh, well, is there anything else you'd like to share me about your recycling philosophy, Julie?|qy
A|I just think that everybody ought to do it.|sd
B|Do they do|qy
B|like, what about, like, uh,|qo
B|what kind of plastic stuff can you recycle, do you know?|qw
A|The only thing I know that you can recycle is milk jugs.|sd
B|Really?|bh
A|Yeah.|b
B|What about like those grocery bags?|qw
A|Oh, yeah,|b
A|they have, uh,|sd
A|uh, what I, what I used to, uh,|sd
A|now that I don't go to the grocery store much, it's kind of moot,|sd
A|but I used to just save up the ones that I got one time and then go and hand them to them the next time and use them over and over.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|but, also most places, like Big Star does|sd
A|and I'm not sure if Kroger does or not|sd
A|but,|%
B|They'll ask you whether you want bags or paper or plastic.|sd
A|Yeah,|aa
A|and they, they have like little, little boxes that you can put your old bags in.|sd
B|uh.|b
A|Can bring them in.|sd
B|Those petroleum products are going to kill us.|sv
A|I know it,|aa
A|I know it.|aa
B|The hostile planet, I think, Julie.|sv
A|It really is a small,  hostile planet|sv
B|The petroleum pretty much, I mean, those petroleum products I think are the big, uh, you know the great Satan of the recycling.|sv
A|Did you know that,|qy
A|No,|ar
A|really not.|sd
A|Did you know that, like, something like fifty percent of the world's landfills is like paper? Filled with paper.|qy
B|Um.|%
B|Paper just seems so innocuous.|sv
A|Huh?|br
B|Paper doesn't seem threatening at all, you know.|sv
A|Well, it is, it is, though.|sd
B|It comes from trees.|sd
B|How can it be bad?|qw
A|It is, because they,|sd
B|They treat it with chemicals or something?|qy^d
B|Why can't trees break down?|qw
B|I don't get it.|sd
A|Well, they do treat paper with chemicals|sd
A|like yellow paper, you know takes something like twenty times as long to decompose.|sd
B|Yep.|b
B|Oh|b
A|You know, you can bury a piece of yellow paper,|sd
A|it will still be there in a couple of weeks.|sd
B|Really?|bh
A|Yeah|aa
B|Huh.|%
A|it will be whole.|sd
A|You'll be able to read  off of it.|sd
B|I'm going to switch  from those yellow legal pads, then.|oo_co_cc
A|Yeah, um.|b
B|I'm glad you told me that, because I use those at work, where I work|sd
B|and, uh, But I can just forget that from now on.|sd
B|I'm going I'm going to switch to the white ones.|oo_co_cc
A|Well, white paper's bad too.|sd
A|They, they treat it, too.|sd
B|Well, what about, uh, papyrus, you know, made out of you know, bamboo stuff, from the from the  banks of the Nile.|qo
A|I'm sure that's fine.|sd
A|I'm sure.|sd
A|Maybe we ought to just start carving in stone again.|ad
B|You think so?|bh
A|Maybe.|no
B|Tablets?|qy
A|Yeah.|ny
B|I think we should just abandon the, you know, the written word altogether, you know.|sv
A|You think?|bh
A|I don't know,|aap_am
A|well, I mean, I think we've kind of, you know,|sv
B|What do you think?|qo
A|I mean, everybody, everybody everybody has a computer.|sv
B|Kind of radical, I know|sv
B|but,|%
A|We would no longer need paper at all.|sv
B|That's true.|aa
B|Everyone had a two way wrist watch T V on their wrist, like, uh, Dick Tracy.|ad
A|I would love that.|sd
