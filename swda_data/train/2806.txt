A|but for some reason or other he had a thing for them.|sd
A|I don't know whether he'd,|sd
A|I think there was one in the school, uh, zoology department, you know, or biology department, one or the other, anyway, uh,|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and anyway, he just, he went and found this guy in, in Dallas somewhere who had picked up one in, I guess in in Mexico,|sd
A|I don't know where.|sd
A|But anyway he brought this home|sd
A|and I looked at him|sd
A|and I said you've got to be kidding, I'm not going to live with a lizard|sd
B|Yuck!|ba
A|But you know I visualize that animal racing about,|sd
A|and you know, like you think of lizards doing but they don't do that.|sd
A|They're very much like, uh,|sv
A|well, the thing about them is that they hold so still you don't notice that they're there|sd
A|and then they move and about scares you to death sometimes.|sd
B|Did you have him in a cage?|qy
A|No,|nn
B|Oh no,|ba
A|he had full run of the house.|sd
B|Oh no,|ba
B|oh no.|ba

B|Uh-huh.|b
A|It was, he was really a neat pet|sd
A|and though I, you know,|%
A|he'd|%
A|when we'd have family home evening and everybody would sit in the living room and the fire would be burning he'd walk across my feet sometimes|sd
B|Oh!|ba
A|And it, it was a long time before I could really pet him|sd
A|and, but I fed him|sd
A|and he, he knew how to get me to feed him.|sd
A|He'd come out to the kitchen, just kind of look at me until I went and got him something out of the refrigerator.|sd
B|Uh.|%
B|Oh no,|ba
B|I mean you don't argue with an iguana, do you.|qy
A|But he was really a neat animal.|sd
A|He, he'd lay in Dan's lap, you know,|sd
A|and just, uh, when he'd pet him, he'd just stretch|sd
A|and, you know, you could see him just enjoying it like a cat does.|sd
B|Oh no.|ba
A|It was kind of interesting.|sv
A|But he did a lot of interesting things|sd
A|and, uh, Dan carried him around|sd
A|and he liked to ride on the back of his, up on his head, you know, with his tail wrapped around his arm so he wouldn't fall off, an, and scare everybody to death|sd
A|and kids loved him,|sv
B|Oh, my goodness.|ba
A|kids just loved him.|sv
A|Kids just came from all over to come and see Clyde and visit with him|sd
A|and, and he tolerated them, you know.|sd
A|He'd even tolerate him petting though,|sd
A|he didn't like them too well at first,|sd
A|but he, he got tame, you know,|sd
A|so that, uh, people could go in there.|sv
A|And Dan was a drummer,|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and he didn't, he, the only thing he didn't like very well was the drumming.|sd
B|Was the drumming.|b^m
A|When Dan would drum he'd sit there and scrunch up, you know|sd
A|like he was trying to protect himself,|sv
B|And cover his ears.|bf
A|and then he'd leave the room|sd
B|Isn't that funny the way we put, you know, um, human characteristics on an animal like that|qy^d

B|Oh.|b
A|and he was so funny.|sd
A|Uh, for a while they built a, a run for him out to the side of the house, you know.|sd
A|He'd been on the patio|sd
A|but they put the run out there,|sd
A|and he didn't like this run because there were no people that came by|sd
A|and sometimes he would just make a racket until you came and got him.|sd
A|And one night we'd forgotten to put water out for him|sd
A|and, and Hal and I were in bed|sd
A|and all of a sudden there was all this noise out to the side the house|sd
A|and, and he'd pick up his dish and throw it in the air And then bark and march around, you know,|sd
B|He used a classic illusion .|ba

B|Oh.|b
A|And then in the summertime you could put him out|sd

B|Okay.|bk
A|and he went there to go to the bathroom.|sd
A|You had to be sure you left the doors open, you know,|sd
A|he didn't like to go anywhere else,|sd
A|he'd, he'd scratch and do all kinds of things to get you to open the door, if you happened to close it on him or something, you know,|sd
A|but, but even when he went, when he had an accident or something, uh,|sd
B|Oh, no.|ba
A|if you just let it dry, it dries kind of like, uh,|sd

A|and you could just vacuum it up.|sd
B|Oh my goodness.|ba
A|In the winter time there was no smell at all, no odor at all to it.|sd
