A|What's the, uh,|%
A|in Texas law has a, uh, what does it have, it has a death penalty doesn't it?|qy
B|Oh, yes,|ny
B|yeah.|ny
B|They just, uh, started it again, too just late, or, within the past few years|sd
B|You know for quite some time, just about every one of the states had given up the death penalty.|sd
A|But now it's coming back into favor.|sv
B|Uh, yes.|aa
B|Well, they find it is more deterrent.|sd
A|Well, my sociology class at S M U's taught us that it was not a deterrent.|sd
A|Uh, but now that's just what they said.|h
A|Uh, I don't know maybe, maybe if I went back and took a sociology class now they'd say it is a deterrent.|h
B|Well, uh, if you, You know, compare the figures, I think that's where they're, uh, they're coming from.|sv
A|Maybe they've changed their minds.|h
B|The, uh,|%
A|Maybe that's it.|aap_am
A|Maybe that's it,|aap_am
A|because that was back in the seventies.|sd
B|Oh, they're yes. They are.|aa
B|That was before the, uh, uh, they adopted the death law again|sd
B|But, uh, I, I myself am in favor of it, uh, particularly for, uh, well I think Texas has a good, good law. Uh, crimes, murders related with, uh, drugs or killing a policemen.|sd
A|I think,|%
A|I agree.|aa
A|But I think it ought to be expanded to include children.|sv
A|I, I think they're, they have they're working on, uh, something in Austin now,|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and I'm not sure what it is,|sd
A|I just remember seeing a, uh, kind of a synopsis of it.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Well, why stop at children?|qh
B|Why not go to adults, too?|qh
A|Well, uh, I'm, I'm personally very in favor of it.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|Uh, why should we let them set in prison and work on their college degrees after they've mowed down a class yard full of kids or or tried to, or done their very, you know, given their best effort at doing that.|qh
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Yep.|aa
A|I, I don't care to support them.|sd
B|Well, I don't either|aa
B|but, uh, uh, but there is something to be said about|%
B|or, uh, uh, just for the sake of argument, I'm taking the,  a con,|oo_co_cc
A|Sure.|aa
B|I'm, I'm against it.|sd
B|Uh, you know yourself how many times have you heard where, uh, uh, a citizen was wrongfully arrested,  and served time at a penitentiary, uh,|sd
A|Uh-huh,|b
A|uh-huh|b
B|just recently this, uh, black man served nine years was it,  for robbery.|sd
A|And then,  there was the black woman that, uh, robbed and shot the furrier.|sd
A|And she was set free, too, just in two examples in Texas recently.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|But she actually killed the furrier. Or someone,|sd
A|she was charged with murder|sd
A|and then, then they decided it was a case of mistaken identity or something.|sd
A|I didn't, I don't, I didn't retain all those facts very well.|sd
A|But I know what you're,|sd
A|what if we make a mistake.|qh
B|That's it.|aa
A|And that's not one of those things that you can turn the wheel back and reverse everything.|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Well, right now our laws are so liberal that, uh, even with the death penalty in effect, I don't think that, uh, they're going to use it, uh, too frequently, uh, unfortunately.|sv
B|I, like you, say yes|aa
B|let's have it,  put them all, give them all a shot, get rid of them.|sv
A|Well,  Well, I guess, though, where I would have a problem with it if I were on the jury that, that, put, that handed down the death sentence because it was my judgement the person's guilty.|sd
B|Why should they be sitting in, uh, prison getting their college degree.|qh
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|Now that's tougher.|sv
A|It's easier to say it on the telephone|sv
A|and everyone agree that, yeah, the death penalty's the way to go,|sv
A|it's a deterrent to crime,|sv
A|they shouldn't catch themselves in that circumstance anyway.|sv
A|But to be the actual one of the ones that decide, that would be tougher for me.|sv
B|Yes,|aa
B|very true.|aa
B|I, uh, I agree with you there. Uh-huh.|aa
A|I think I'd probably do it|sd
A|but we could never say what we would do if we're not in the circumstance.|sv
A|It, that's, that's, that's a real easy thing to say that, oh, sure I would,|sv
A|but I don't know|h
B|Well, I myself wouldn't want to be on the jury like that.|sd
B|Uh, I, it, it's, uh, that's an awful lot to, uh, to expect of a person, to, uh, to kill somebody is what it amounts to.|sv
A|Well, yes,|aa
A|but, you know, that's what they did.|sv
B|It,|%
B|true.|aa
B|Very true.|aa
B|But they, they did it because they have a warped mind for some reason.|sv
A|Or rather than have a warped mind it was just the only way to get whatever they wanted.|sv
B|Yeah Uh-huh|b
A|And they, they wanted something worse than they, more than they respect the human life.|sv
B|Yeah,|aa
B|exactly.|aa
B|Well, anyhow I guess we both agree that,  that it is,  it should be in effect.|sv
A|Hang them.|ad
A|Yeah,|aa
A|I agree it should be in effect.|aa
A|Also I agree there should be a lot of care in the enforcement, uh,|sv
A|so I guess I would say I want it to be in effect|sd
A|but I want maybe|%
A|well, I'd, I, now I have a problem with this, too.|sd
A|I think our courts have too many opportunities for them to go back and get one more chance.|sv
B|Oh, that's true.|aa
B|Well now any, uh, just believe in just about any state in the union, uh, uh, a death, uh, or, uh, yeah, death verdict is an automatic, uh, appeal.|sd
A|That's correct.|aa
A|It is,|sd
A|it is.|sd
B|And, uh, uh, yes,|aa
B|I'm inclined to agree with you.|aa
B|I think so,|aa
B|there should be a limit as to the number of appeals.|sv
A|Now, there's some,|sd
A|and maybe, now, I don't remember if this is Texas or not, that has something about all drug dealers can be sentenced to the death sentence.|sd
B|Um, um, well, Not just for dealing in drugs.|arp_nd
A|Convicted drug dealers.|sd
B|It, uh,|%
A|Is it, what is, what's the|%
B|There are certain circumstances,|sd
B|and I don't remember what they are.|sd
A|It's something of the they're on the distribution end.|sd
B|Uh, yes.|aa
A|They're not selling them,|sd
A|they're distributing them.|sd
A|It's for the large dealers is what,  it's reserved for.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And they, they are in effect killing people.|sd
B|Oh, oh, yes,|aa
B|yes.|aa
B|I, I believe it's any capital crime related to drugs.|sv
A|Oh, okay.|bk
B|I think that's the way it's worded.|sd
A|Is that how it's worded?|qy
A|I knew it was there|sd
A|but, I, I,|%
A|or or is it proposed|qy
A|or is it passed?|qy
B|I do believe that's in.|sd
B|Uh, I wouldn't swear to it myself.|h
A|I believe it is,|sd
B|But I thought it, I thought it was in effect.|sd
A|I believe you're right, though.|sd
A|I think it is.|sd
A|And I have to agree with that.|aa
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|I, I think it certainly should be one of the options.|sv
A|Uh, I've been fortunate with my children and grandchildren, so far that I know.|sd
A|I qualify that heavily,|sd
A|because you never know,|h
A|but to the best of my knowledge we haven't had a major problem yet. Well, my children are about in the same age bracket.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Oh, it does.|aa
B|Uh, I have four sons myself|sd
B|and the youngest is twenty-eight,|sd
B|so they are all pretty well grown up|sd
B|and they all went through it, you know, going through high school and everything|sd
B|and knock wood that, uh, they have not,|sd
B|well I won't say they didn't try it, uh,|sd
B|I wouldn't know,|h
B|but, uh, they,|%
B|I doubt very much that they're, they're using it now.|sd
B|In fact I'm sure they don't.|sd
A|I think, let's see, the oldest is thirty-two|sd
A|and the youngest is probably twenty-seven, twenty-eight.|sd
B|Huh.|b
A|So, it's the same age bracket.|sd
B|Yes.|aa
A|And there's four, two girls and two boys.|sd
A|And I think one of each experimented very slightly with pot,|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and I think that was the extent of it to the best of my knowledge.|sd
B|Yeah.|aa
B|That's usually the way it is.|sv
B|It, it's just, uh, try it out with their peers|sv
B|And none of them even smoke.|sd
B|They don't, uh,|%
B|they never,|%
B|strangely enough, uh, their mother and I both smoked when they were growing up.|sd
B|Now, my, my, my wife, my ex-wife, she quit, uh, well, when she was pregnant with the last one|sd
B|and she never started up again.|sd
B|And I just quit, oh, about fourteen months and two weeks ago.|sd
A|Boy,|ba
A|that's tough.|ba
B|Yes,|aa
B|it is.|aa
B|I,|%
B|and it seems to be getting tougher as time goes by.|sv
A|My husband hasn't quit, yet.|sd
A|And he knows he has to|sd
A|and he knows he should|sd
A|and he knows|sd
A|and he knows,|sd
B|Um.|b
A|but he hasn't.|sd
A|I do respect the fact, though, that he refuses to smoke in the same room with me.|sd
A|He, he's very conscious of, of passive smoking|sd
A|and he's concerned about it but,  hasn't quite made it yet|sd
B|Well,  Well, when I was still smoking, I, I felt that way.|sd
B|If I was in a public restaurant, seated at table with, uh, non smokers I would try to pick a a, a my, seat where the smoke would blow away from them.|sd
B|Or I'd hold the cigarette under the table.|sd
A|Yeah,|b
A|I've seen all of this,|sd
A|yeah|%
B|And, uh, but, uh, now I'm on, the shoe's on the other foot|sd
B|Uh, I'm aware of other people smoking now.|sd
A|Well, Charles will actually, Charles will not smoke in anyone else's house except our own.|sd
B|Um.|b
A|He will get up|sd
A|and he'll go outside, you know,|sd
A|and he, he's|%
A|so, when we're invited to people's house, he will not smoke in their house. Which I think is good because there's a lot of people that are very,|sd
B|Yes.|b
A|particularly if they have children.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|But, uh, and he's, you know, he tries his best,|sd
A|but the actual quitting he hasn't done.|sd
A|He changed brands to a brand he doesn't like.|sd
A|He put up all of his ash trays.|sd
A|He will not smoke in a comfortable position, you know,|sd
A|but still he's done everything the Smokers Anonymous tell you to do except quit smoking|sd
B|Uh, uh-huh.|b
A|It's a,  long process.|sv
B|Well, the,  there's a trick I use.|sd
B|They used to leave my cigarettes in the glove compartment.|sd
A|Oh, how neat.|ba
B|And every time I wanted one I have to go outside and just take one. One at a time.|sd
B|And, uh, that, that 's, gets to be, uh, a deterrent.|sd
A|He has his in the kitchen,|sd
