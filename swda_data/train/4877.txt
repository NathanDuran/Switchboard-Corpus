A|Yeah.|b
A|What did you do when your kids were growing up?|qw
A|Were you,|%
B|Well, when, when|%
B|the, uh, the first, uh, ten years, see first ten or twelve years, I stayed home.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And, uh, then after that I, I went to work.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And, uh, uh, uh, a couple of times I just, uh, uh, you know,|sd
B|then I had one job|sd
B|and then that job ran out because it was kind of a government seeded type job.|sd
B|And then, and then like about, later I, I tried to get the baby to a baby-sitter.|sd
B|Supposed to be good, uh, recommended person from the church|sd
B|and I knew her personally.|sd
B|She had two kids of her own and everything.|sd
B|But I quit my job because I couldn't stand how she was taking care of my child.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|I mean, first of all, uh, her children were sick all the time.|sd
B|So when my son stayed over there, he got sick.|sd
A|He got sick,|b^m
A|yeah.|b
B|Same thing, same thing that the, her kids had,|sd
B|right?|^g
A|Right.|b^m
A|Well,|%
B|And so, uh, we didn't take her over there until like about eleven o'clock.|sd
B|Then he, she'd take my son and her daughter over to kindergarten.|sd
B|But|%
B|that day, uh, I was saying now he, he's sick.|sd
B|And she goes well, she goes, he has the same thing that all my kids have.|sd
B|That's what he got, you know.|sd
B|Goes, well, okay,|sd
B|so it's not like he's going to infect her kids.|sd
B|But then what happened was, is, I said, uh, he just threw up|sd
B|and kindergarten starts at eleven thirty|sd
B|so she said well she'll keep him home|sd
B|and he'll probably just sleep anyway.|sd
B|Well, you know, what|qh
B|that woman sent her, sent him to kindergarten.|sd
B|She sent him to kindergarten.|sd
B|As soon as he went there, the teacher took one look at him|sd
B|and he threw up again|sd
B|and they put him in the nursery, uh, they put him in the nurse's office.|sd
A|yeah.|b
B|And then what happened was, is, you know, they gave her a call because they knew that she was my baby-sitter.|sd
B|Called her|sd
B|and they said, uh, that he's sick.|sd
B|Well she wasn't home.|sd
A|Huh.|%
B|I mean her, all her kids were sick|sd
B|but she wasn't home, right.|sd
B|And her, and her, her daughter that was in kindergarten with him also did not go to school because she was sick.|sd
B|Now why didn't he, why didn't she keep him home with her?|qh
B|No,|nn
B|she didn't do that.|sd
B|So, it got to the point where he's, he's supposed to get out of, uh, kindergarten like about two thirty.|sd
B|And I had to leave work.|sd
B|It was, it was five o'clock in the evening|sd
B|and I found out he was still there at school.|sd
B|And they were calling me|sd
B|and they said somebody's got to pick him up.|sd
B|And I kept thinking that she was going to get picked up, she was going to pick him up because she only lives in like two blocks away from the school.|sd
B|I was trying to get my husband to come and pick him up and all that kind of stuff.|sd
B|And he had a hundred and four fever.|sd
B|They couldn't, uh, give him anything because they're not allowed to at school and everything.|sd
A|Right.|b
B|I was so furious.|sd
B|I, I quit that job|sd
B|and I stayed home for awhile longer.|sd
B|Then I went and got a, uh, a job in real estate where I can kind of adjust my time a little bit better.|sd
A|Yeah,|aa
A|a little more flexibility.|bf
A|You can come and go.|bf
B|Yeah,|aa
B|but, uh, I haven't had any good, really very good experience with child care|sd
A|Yeah.|b
A|When, when our kids were small we had a couple of, uh, good, good women who, uh, would often uh, get them to come to the house.|sd
