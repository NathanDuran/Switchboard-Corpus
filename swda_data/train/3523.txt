A|We're set.|sd
B|Okay.|bk
A|What changes do you feel have happened?|qw
B|Oh, I guess the first thing has been the, uh, for the right, for women to vote.|sv
B|I think that has been a major change and also the fact that, uh, there are so many more women in the work force nowadays than there were|sv
B|and that's probably going to increase. You know.|sv
A|Right.|b
A|Increases each year, doesn't it?|qy
B|I'm sorry?|br
A|It increases each year I think.|sv
B|It sure does.|aa
B|Yeah,|aa
B|there is a lot more women in the work place nowadays.|sv
A|Well, and I think women have kind of had, uh, in the past the real subservient role.|sv
B|Role?|^2
B|Right.|aa
A|And, uh,|%
B|That's changing|sv
A|Well, we do to some degree|sv
B|Right.|b
A|but, uh, uh, I think it's not as much as it was.|sv
B|Right,|aa
B|yeah,|aa
B|I, I agree.|aa
B|It definitely has changed.|sv
A|I, And especially, I think with women increasingly working, they're going to have to demand more from men.|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|Because there is just, impossible to keep up on everything else.|sv
B|Yeah,|b
B|yeah.|b
A|Have more of an active role in taking care of children, more of an active role in taking care of the home.|sv
B|Well, you know, they've been talking about|%
B|and I don't know, uh, what the status is on it,|h
B|but, you know, women get maternity leave and stuff like that|sd
B|and I know that they've, there has been discussion about men also getting maternity leave to help out,|sd
A|Right.|b
B|but you know, I haven't really heard much about that recently.|h
A|Well, you know, there is a lot of companies that won't give women maternity leave for that very reason.|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|Uh, in fact, I know the school districts down here, you, they don't have maternity leave.|sd
A|Uh you simply have to take, accumulate your sick leave. And take your sick leave.|sd
B|Oh, is that right?|bh
B|Oh.|b
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And I don't know, uh, if bigger company companies do,|h
A|but when I was employed with the school district, I didn't have maternity leave either|sd
A|and that was the reason|sd
A|because they thought was showing prejisim to women and not to men|sd
A|but, So, uh,|%
B|Huh, that's interesting.|ba
B|That's a bummer, though|sv
A|Yeah|aa
A|it is.|aa
B|I mean, You got to take the time off|sd
A|You have to save all of your, uh, vacation time.|sd

B|Yeah.|b
A|but, uh,|%
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|What do you see, uh, changing in the future?|qw
B|I think that we're probably going to see a lot more companies, uh, run by females.|sv
A|Right,|aa
A|and, and  top level.|%
B|And we'll|%
B|I'm sorry?|br
A|Maybe top level.|sv
B|Right,|aa
B|right,|aa
B|upper management,|sv
B|more women in upper management|sv
B|and probably, uh, we'll see more females in political roles.|sv
B|More governors and, I think, you know, roles like that.|sv
A|That would be kind of nice|ba
B|Well, we've got, in Texas, we have a female governor.|sd
A|That's right,|aa
A|that's right.|aa
B|And we had a female mayor here in Dallas,|sd
B|and she just, her term just ended|sd
B|and, uh, so I think we're probably going to see more of that in the future|sv
A|Yeah|b
A|I think that's probably good.|sv
A|A little more integration.|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And, uh, maybe not so much that we sit on the back burners|sv
A|and,|%
B|Right, you know,|b
B|I mean, and that's fine with me|ba
A|I think,|%
B|but sometimes,|%
B|I mean I'm not a women's libber by any means,|sd
B|but I do,|%
A|Right.|b
B|there are issues that, you know, as far as, like, equal pay for men and women and that kind of stuff, I totally am for.|sv
A|Right.|b
B|But, I don't get into the, uh, the real  women libber movement, you know.|sd
A|No,|aa
A|I don't either.|aa
A|I don't think they're ever going to prove that men and women are equal|sv
B|Yeah.|b
A|We just function differently|sv
B|Right,|aa
B|right.|aa
A|And, uh, I'm not capable of lifting what, uh, a man can lift and you know, that type of, that type of thing,|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|but, uh one of the big changes, uh, they're doing in Salt Lake is, uh,|%
B|Right.|b
A|and they're probably,|%
A|I'm sure, in Dallas since you're big places, a lot more women are, uh, working right out of their home with their P C's or with their lap computers or whatever.|sv
B|Yeah,|aa
B|I, I've heard of that.|aa
B|Uh, I haven't really talked to anybody that's, you know, too involved with that.|sd
B|But, I mean, I think that is a,|%
A|I think that,|%
B|Like the cottage industry.|sv
B|Is, is that what you're talking about, women working out of their homes?|qy
A|Right.|na
B|Yeah,|bk
B|uh, I think it's wonderful|sv
A|Right.|b

A|and,|%
B|Yeah.|b
A|Course, they're talking about, uh, that we're going to be able to do our grocery shopping and banking and everything like that,|sd
B|Oh, I|%
B|By the phone and all that.|^2
A|so, uh, it would be kind of exciting in some ways to, to see a little bit more of that|sv
A|and some ways, it might be kind of scary.|sv
B|Right.|b
A|Think anybody could do it,|sv
A|but, Anyway,|%
B|Right.|b
B|Yeah,|b
B|I wouldn't mind just calling up the grocery store and giving them my order and going an hour later and picking it up|sv
A|Right.|b
A|Right,|b

A|Would you have to give them the brand You know, when you shop, you usually compare the prices|qh
