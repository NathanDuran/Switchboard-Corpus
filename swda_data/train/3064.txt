A|Do you use credit cards a good bit?|qy
B|I do,|na
B|and I wish I didn't|sd
A|Uh.|b
B|Before I got married, uh, about the only credit cards I used were gas cards, because I didn't like carrying, you know  the cash with me all the time,|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|but I just never wanted to get into the hang-up of using credit cards and having all those bills hanging over my head.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|In fact, I remember getting my first MasterCard,|sd
B|and the only reason I got it was, you know, there was a while years ago when you couldn't cash a check without like a MasterCard or VISA.|sd
A|Okay.|b
A|Absolutely.|b
A|Right.|b
B|And so that's why I went ahead and got one.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|It was a mistake|sd
A|Yeah.|b
A|Well, actually, I, I have a whole wallet full of credit cards.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|I don't use them very often.|sd
A|Um, oh, I may use, I try to use at least one gasoline credit card a week, and try to use a different one, so that, you know, I have, keep those active.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|I have a half a dozen department store credit cards,|sd
A|and I, I'll use those if I need to run in and buy a dozen pair hose right quick or something like that,|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|just enough to keep them active.|sd
A|My biggies are the VISA, MasterCard and Discover.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|And for the most part, I had used those for like, uh, charging airline tickets, where I can pay for those, you know, you could make the transaction over the telephone,|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|or I fly Southwest a good little bit, which means I can just run that card through the machine.|sd
B|That's right.|aa
A|Uh, and it saves a lot time.|sd
A|And that's what I was using it for.|sd
A|However, we had a, had a, a very pressing financial family crisis, which said you have no alternative,|sd
A|you must have the money to do this with,|^q
A|and you do not have any other options|^q
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|so I charged all three of those cards up,|sd
A|and right now I am paying and praying.|sd
B|I know how that goes|ba
A|But, uh,|%
B|and that's exactly what we've, I mean I have to say I have been thankful for them, because there were times when it was just like that when we had to have the money|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Uh-huh|b
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|we had no way around it|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and the only way to do it is go get, you know, an advance on a card|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Uh-huh|b
B|and so like you were paying for it,|sd
B|but it's one of those I'm glad it was there.|sd
A|Well, I never did, Right.|sd
A|I never did use it for an advance.|sd
A|Most of my charges were, uh, medications.|sd
B|Oh, I see.|b
A|Didn't have cash for the medications|sd
A|or it was, uh, the doctor would accept MasterCard or VISA.|sd
B|Oh.|b
A|And, uh, a lot of times you can get by using those for, uh, uh,|sv
A|different labs will use those charge accounts for,|sv
B|What,|%
B|Do you find now, though, that even some doctors won't?|qy
B|I've found some doctors that say, you know,|^h
B|I was so used to doctors or medical care places taking credit cards,|^h
B|and so many of them don't anymore.|na
A|Uh-huh|b
B|So,|%
A|Well, I have not,|%
A|like I said, that was just one period in my life where that was critical.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|I don't generally charge.|sd
A|I say well, I need a checkup in six months,|sd
A|and I kind of set that aside and just pay for it.|sd
B|Right.|b
A|I'm reimbursed on insurance anyway,|sd
A|and I can handle, you know, paying for it and waiting two or three weeks.|sd
B|Right.|b
A|Getting into a credit card fiasco is easy.|sv
B|Oh, it is|aa
A|It is easy,|sv
A|and it's very difficult to get out.|sv
A|I just cringe every month when I see those interest charges.|sd
B|I know.|aa
A|I say wow,|sd
A|I, I ought to go to the credit union and borrow the money and pay this off.|^q
A|Big deal,|^q
A|I'm saving two percent.|^q
B|Right.|b
B|But, you know, the interest, even though it bothered me, it didn't used to bother me so much, because, of course, you could list it on a Schedule A|sd
B|and you got all your interest, you know towards your tax deductions,|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and now they've messed that up to where it really is a financial burden to have to pay it.|sv
A|Right.|b
B|And but it, but it is easy to get into a credit card problem,|sv
B|and I, I think about young people that think, you know,|sv
B|there's kind of that feeling of hey, it's so neat,|sv
B|I have my first credit card|^q
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and, and they just don't understand that you still have to be able to make the payments.|sd
A|Oh, yeah,|aa
A|and it's not just paying back what you've charged,|sv
B|You know.|qh
A|it's paying that and half again.|sv
B|That's right.|aa
B|That's right.|aa
A|Uh, you send in, uh, uh, fifty dollars,|sv
A|you're going to pay twenty, twenty-five in interest charges.|sv
B|That's right.|aa
A|You only get half of that paid for the principal,|sv
A|so I'm looking at three or four years before my balances are cleared on those charge accounts.|sd
B|Right.|b
A|Now, as the monthly payment, uh, I mean as the monthly payment amount goes down, that will free up more cash where I can continue to make the larger payments.|sd
B|Right.|b
A|Uh, as long as I don't have a major disaster where I have to use it again, I can, I can do that.|sd
B|Right.|b
A|Meantime, though, I'm not building any reserves.|sd
B|No,|aa
B|and that's frightening to me.|sv
A|Anything that I could be put aside into savings is going for interest on those cards.|sd
B|That's right.|aa
B|That's frightening, too.|ba
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|Uh, I, I just, I, my husband is in business for himself|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|I work for T I|sd
B|but he doesn't|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and, uh, we're, uh, I, I've kind of got my fingers crossed.|sd
B|I've learned when you're in business for yourself, that, that you don't count on something until it's happened you know,|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|but he's got some, you know, it's those once in a lifetime cases,|sd
B|and after ten years he's got two of them|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and they should pay through next month,|sd
B|and, and we're both just looking at each other every night going man, that will pay off like both of our MasterCards, you know.|sd
A|Oh, right,|b
A|right.|b
B|And, you know, just in one lump,|sd
B|because that's the only way you can do it, is to have a big chunk of money|sv
A|Uh-huh,|aa
A|uh-huh.|aa
B|or it's like you say,|sv
B|you pay forever.|sv
A|Uh-huh,|aa
A|uh-huh.|aa
B|And so I'm really looking forward to that.|sd
A|Well, you either need a big chunk of money|sv
A|or you need a large reserve so that if you do charge on that account, you can make a single lump sum payment.|sv
B|That's right.|aa
A|Now, those are very handy|sv
B|Right.|b
A|if you have the reserves and you can make lump sum payments, sharp, good no problem|sv
B|Sure,|aa
B|yeah.|aa
B|I agree.|aa
A|because you're living on the other guy's money for a while.|sd
B|That's right|aa
A|But I can promise you that those credit card companies are going to ride high on my money|sd
B|I know|aa
B|and,|%
A|And it just irks me.|sd
A|I say my gosh, I had to work three hours just to pay the interest on this,|sd
A|and I've got three cards.|sd
A|I've lost a whole day of my life to interest.|sd
B|I know.|aa
B|You're like what am I working for today|sv
A|Yeah,|aa
A|yeah.|aa
A|And that just blows my mind.|sd
A|I, my house is paid for,|sd
A|my car is paid for,|sd
A|I've got some home improvements,|sd
A|but even the payment on that doesn't equal the payment on one of those credit cards.|sd
B|It's incredible.|ba
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|Boy, I wish I could say that my house and,|sd
B|well, my car is paid for now.|sd
B|It was wrecked three weeks ago,|sd
B|but, but you see again the credit cards came in handy.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|I had to have the money to pay rental car, pay this, pay that till the insurance company pays back.|sd
A|That's right.|aa
A|I think that is a good, healthy, safe use of credit cards.|sv
B|And, uh,|%
B|Yeah.|b
B|Because you know that's coming back to pay it off.|sd
A|Uh-huh,|aa
A|uh-huh.|aa
A|Uh, I went to a seminar,|sd
A|they said don't ever use your credit card for consumable items.|sd
A|You only use credit cards for investments.|^q
B|Right.|b
A|I said for crying out loud, if I had the money to you know, if I could do some investing, you'd have to invest at better than twenty percent earnings in order to pay for the payments on the credit card.|sd
B|It's,|%
B|Sure.|b
B|That's right.|aa
A|That doesn't make a bit of sense to me.|sv
A|I thought God dang, where is his pencil?|sd
B|That's right.|aa
B|Well, the smart half was don't pay it for consumables,|sv
B|don't, you know, if you can't afford to go to a restaurant and eat out and pay cash, don't put it on a credit card you know,|sv
A|That's right.|aa
B|and, and so that, that is the smart half.|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|But, uh, and I can remember before we had kids, we did that a lot,|sd
B|but it was no biggie you know, because we could pay it off,|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|while after kids, and you're paying child care and other things, all of a sudden it's not so easy to pay off,|sv
B|so we cut that out real quick|sd
A|Uh-huh,|b
A|uh-huh.|b
B|And, uh, but I, I do like having them there.|sd
B|There is a bit of security in having the credit cards and knowing that in times of crisis, they are there to use|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|but you have to have a very good sense of saving, and or common sense not, not to get yourself in trouble.|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Uh-huh|b
A|You also have to have that willingness to commit to that because you're committing a good portion of your life and income when you do it.|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
