B|and I've taken care of a few AIDS patients.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|Uh, when they asked us did, did we want to, uh, keep it the same or, uh, spend more, spend less, I think uh, I think right now what they're spending is adequate. Uh, my, for my personal opinion.

A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Uh-huh.|b

A|Yeah.|b
B|or I think they already would have by now, you know.|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And, uh, so I don't know if, if spending a lot more money would really make any difference right now.|sv

A|Uh-huh.|ny
A|Yeah.|b
B|And, uh, that sort of thing.|%
B|Uh, if, if we were talking about the money, uh, I'd just have to say what they're spending is probably enough, simply because I don't know that much about it. You know|sd
