B|my sister lives in Turkey,|sd
B|so when I was like fourteen, fifteen, I went, I went to Turkey.|sd
A|Oh,|b
B|And this Christmas, I went to Turkey.|sd

B|for the past couple of years, I,|%
B|since my parents are, are, well,|%
B|I'm from Argentina,|sd
B|and my parents live down there.|sd
B|So, all the traveling I do is alone.|sd

B|uh, a very, uh, family thing, you know, made, like go skiing in Vermont or something.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|That was, uh, that was a lot of fun.|sd
A|Yes.|b
B|But, what happens is we used to fight a lot,|sd
B|so there's never much of a family family thing.|sd
B|You know, one of those hell family vacations.|sd
A|Oh, yes,|b
A|but we try, you know, I try,|%
A|my husband also, we're involved in everything our kids does|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|because, uh, my dad died, you know, when I was less than a year old|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|so I always just had a mother.|sd
A|So I always thought, when I have kids, you know, I really want to be involved with them.|sd
B|Well, my dad, all he, all he wanted to do was get money for us,|sd
B|so he could buy us material things.|sd
A|Material things,|b^m
A|yes,|b
A|that is,|%
A|yes,|%
B|And, and to me, you know, it's like, now I'm twenty-two,|sd
B|but I still feel, you know,|%
B|it's like yeah, we never threw a football or something|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and the way I was brought up,|sd
B|and he wants me now,|sd
B|he, like he, you know, like he wants to be best friends now|sd
A|Best friends, now.|b^m
B|and it's very hard for me|sd
B|because, you know, it's like you grow up to be twenty years old,|sd
B|and it's always the same man|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and then suddenly he sees that he's getting old,|sd
B|and he wants to be best friends|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|but, uh, you know, it's like, I can only express myself so much,|sd
B|because, you know, um, everything that he taught me, you know, that my family taught me, which is very hard to change that all of a sudden from one year to the next and say, I'm sorry, you know.|sd
B|It's like, you know, I love you|sd
B|and let's go out and do things together when I don't feel like it, you know|^q
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and so, that's that whole thing that he'll say when, like, like|sd
B|I've seen my uncle and his family, you know, does everything together,|sd
B|and you know, his kids are, you know,|%
B|when his little girl was five years old and everything, they, uh, they would go to the beach,|sd
B|and she could go to sleep at two in the morning you know|sd
A|Oh, uh-huh.|b
A|Yeah.|b
B|and, uh, I was brought up the same way,|sd
B|it doesn't matter what age you have,|sd
B|just so long as you can get up to go to class the next morning, you can stay up you know,|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|but his, what he does is, when he gets home, he separates his work from his house.|sd
A|Yeah,|b
A|you have to|%
B|Yeah.|b
A|I mean, you honestly do.|sd
A|Now I have friends that I love to death,|sd
A|but, and they have children,|sd
A|but their children does anything,|sd
A|we have to take them, and, you know to do it.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|And that really gets kind of aggravating after a while|sd
A|because you're saying, Well, I work full time too, you know.|sd
B|Yeah,|b
B|yeah,|b
B|but, uh, it's just, it's just something that, you know,|%
B|my theory is, you know, when, when you have kids and all you, you want to do, well,|%
B|what I'll do is, you know, like,|%
B|I mean, you might have problems,|sv
B|but it's not your kids' problems you know,|sv
A|Yeah,|aa
A|oh, yeah.|aa
B|and you got to try to be with them as much as you can|sv
B|and to, you know, like,|%
B|thing is, is, that, you know, like if, if they would ever happen to have a drug problem, suppose, that they could feel comfortable coming to me and saying, I got a problem you know,|sv
A|Problem,|b^m
A|uh-huh|b
B|and, uh and that would make any parent feel good and bad at the same time, you know,|sv
A|Yeah.|b
B|first of all you're coming to me|sv
B|and let's see how we can get rid of the problem, you know,|sv
B|and that's uh, that's very, that's very hard to do,|sv
B|because once you're best friends with your parents, then, I think everything go a lot better.|sv
A|Uh-huh,|b
A|yeah,|aa
A|I agree with you very much so.|aa
A|Now, we waited several years before we started having children because we was still in college,|sd
A|and we knew time wise, or, and money wise, too|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|would, it would not have been a good idea to had them then.|sv
B|Yeah,|b
B|my, my father was raising four oh well, three kids before he had me,|sd
B|so it was, uh, you know,|%
B|you're trying, to support, uh, four kids,|sv
B|and it's pretty hard you know,|sv
A|Yeah.|b
B|and I, I told him, listen you could have had a lot of money if you would have only had two kids.|sd
A|Uh-huh,|b
A|yeah.|b
B|He says yeah,|sd
B|but then I wouldn't have you,|^q
B|I go, yeah,|sd
B|but then you would have a lot of money|^q
A|That's right,|aa
A|but you can't take this money with us, though|sv
B|Yeah.|b
A|that's how I keep looking at it.|sd
B|But, you know, like, four, I mean four children is expensive, especially when you consider like, especially for me, which I'm paying out of state tuition.|sd
B|I'm paying, you know, three thousand,|sd
B|no,|ar
B|what is it, two thousand six hundred dollars for one semester.|sd
A|Oh.|b
B|And, you know, people say, you know, it's expensive to think it's college,|sd
B|but, if, if everybody would be a little bit responsible, you know,|sd
B|it's like,|%
B|what does it, what does it cost.|t1
B|It costs five hundred dollars a semester suppose.|sd
B|Now they go to a state college|sd
B|and they live at home you know,|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and well, it costs two hundred dollars for books,|sd
B|but you know, seven hundred dollars a semester,|sd
B|a lot of people can spare that if they planned ahead, you know, like|sv
A|Oh, yeah,|aa
A|if you if you can,|%
A|yeah.|aa
B|I mean, it's like, if you plan a year ahead, you can probably save up seven hundred dollars you know, one thousand four hundred dollars to send your child to college, you know.|sv
A|Yeah.|b
A|What are you learning to be?|qw
B|Oh, oh, excuse me?|br
