B|but I, I just, you know, sometimes I just don't like everybody knowing everything about me, you know,|sd
B|so,|%
A|Well, that's very, can be very, very true.|aa
B|So, and you know, everybody just gives you a credit card just so you'll spend money|sv
B|so,|%
A|Well, that's the idea.|sv
A|They figure that, if they give you card, at no charge for a whole year that you will use it|sv
B|Yeah.|b
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and,|%
B|That's right.|aa
B|See they make money off of it, whether you use it or not.|sv
A|Absolutely.|aa
A|Well, the other thing, of course, is the fact that they hope, you will not pay your bill at the end of the month,  so that you would be paying interest.|sv
B|That's right.|aa
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|I use mine a great deal, um, for groceries, for everything that I can and, then just write one check at the end of the month,  for the entire thing,|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|That's what I do.|sd

B|and then, but I don't charge anything that I can't payoff at the end of the month.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|So,|%
A|Well, uh, do you, uh, do you ever use the A T M machines?|qy
B|No,|nn
B|I never do.|sd
B|My husband does at work just to get cash out,|sd
B|but, uh, I take the checkbook|sd
B|so I, you know, I, just, if I need cash, I just tell him|sd
B|and he gets it out|sd
B|and I don't even think I know my number|sd
A|Well, I find it a great use from the standpoint that you don't have to continue to write checks, in order to get cash.|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|That's right.|aa
B|See we, he couldn't do without it, but, you know, since he can just do it right there at work,  for nothing .|sd
A|Oh, that helps.|^2
A|Right.|b
B|Yeah.|b
A|Well the, the other thing some people are not aware of, is they will use their A, their credit card like their Visa or their MasterCard for cash|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and when they do that, they begin paying interest right from that very day on.|sv
B|You're right.|aa
B|And that's kind of silly.|sv
A|Yeah right.|aa
A|Absolutely.|aa
B|Yeah.|b
A|Because they, they figure that, that's correct|sv
B|You're defeating the purpose.|sv
A|The idea is to use their money|sv
B|Yeah.|b
A|And, uh, during that whole month and, then pay it at the end of the month.|sv
B|Yeah.|b
B|Yeah,|aa
B|I mean, I get, I get at least one or two a week. People, you know, sending me a credit card or calling me on the phone and I just say I don't want it.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Right.|b
B|Because I,|%
A|Well, I think that's the only thing you can do, is just say no and mean no and,  not be tempted.|sv
B|Yeah.|aa
B|It's like,  I'd like to know where they determine that I'm such a good credit risk that they can go and say, you get this much credit line. You know.|sd

B|Yeah.|b
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Yeah.|b
B|And, then, some people they get so wrapped up in them that they find, you know, one day they find, wow, I didn't realize I had this much, you know, I'd spent this much money.|sv
A|That much stuff.|^2
A|Right.|b
B|And, then they can't meet the minimum monthly payments on it.|sv
A|Well, and some people use one credit card to pay for another credit card they own,|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and, I mean, that does nothing, but exacerbate the entire problem.|sv
B|Yeah,|aa
B|it does because you're, you know, you, you're, you know, you're just costing yourself more money because you, if you can't make the monthly, the minimum payment, you're paying interest, again|sv
A|That's right.|ba
