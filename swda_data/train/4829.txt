A|Okay Uh, let me see.|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
A|Unfortunately, we are not much into recycling.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|We don't, we don't do enough.|sd
A|I know we don't so|sd
A|Uh, although lately I've been, uh,|sd
A|a friend of mine that I spend a lot of time with does recycle quite a bit|sd
A|and it's, it's, it's, uh, interesting to watch some of the things that she does|sd
A|and then she's almost had an impact on me, uh, where she doesn't say anything to me when she comes to my house but I can kind of tell it bothers her so, just unconsciously I've, I've stopped buying a lot of, uh, uh, paper plates and paper cups|sd
A|and I don't do that anymore.|sd
A|I don't know why,|sd
A|I just don't I just, just from socializing with her|sd
A|so.|%
B|How do you, how, uh, is recycling done in your community?|qw
B|Is,|%
A|It really, it, there's not a whole lot,|sd
A|there really isn't.|sd
A|Uh, I know in my mother's neighborhood in San Antonio, each, each house has,|sd
A|they're, they're given three baskets|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and they put them out on a certain day of the week|sd
B|Right.|b
A|and each, uh, home does participate|sd
A|but we really don't have anything, uh, close in this area that, that do anything.|sd
A|And, and some of the communities that do, the residents are having to pay to participate in it. Which really doesn't make sense.|sv
B|Oh.|b
B|Right.|b
B|Over here, they, uh, have several private companies that you can take, uh, recycled, materials to.|sd
B|But, uh, if you want to take them all to one place, they have, uh, the first Saturday of every month, they have certain places that you can drop them off.|sd
B|That's what I do.|sd
B|Uh, and I, I recycle aluminum, glass, uh, newspapers.|sd
A|Yeah,|b
A|that's good.|ba
B|So it's nice to have, you know, one place that you can take them all to instead of driving the glass to one place|sv
A|Yeah,|b
A|yeah.|b
A|That's another thing.|sd
A|You have to go to different places to do that.|sd
B|Right.|b
B|So it's, so that's nice.|sv
B|It would be, it would be really nice if they, uh, came to the house to pick it up|sv
B|and they just were talking about a bill in Tucson about that,|sd
B|but, uh, uh, it didn't go through.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|But I heard that most homes that do participate in that are having to pay a monthly fee to do that. Which, uh,|sd
A|I don't know,|h
A|it just doesn't make sense to me.|sv
B|Right.|b
B|I guess what they, what they were talking about here was, uh, was reducing the garbage collection in order to make that up or something, you know.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
A|Yeah.|b
B|Uh, so I guess that's one option.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
A|That's good,|ba
A|that's good.|ba
B|I guess one thing they're working on now is recycling plastics too.|sd
B|Like, uh|%
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|have you noticed that on the bottom of plastic goods, they have this little number now that tells what  kind of plastic it is?|qy
A|Huh.|%
A|No.|nn
B|Yeah,|b
B|I guess the problem with plastic is there's so many different kinds that you can't recycle,|sd
B|you can't just throw all plastic into one recycler.|sd
A|Oh, I didn't know that.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
B|So now they're like marking, uh,|sd
B|they're,|%
B|I don't know,|h
B|there's six, seven, eight different kind of plastics|sd
B|and they, they mark on the bottom what kind it is.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|So I guess that makes it easy to recycle|sd
B|and then they're, they're, uh, trying to make plastic goods that don't have a bunch of different plastics in them, you know, that are, that are only made out of one kind of plastic|sd
B|so that that makes it easier I guess.|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Well, that's good.|ba
A|I, I'm, you know,|%
A|unfortunately Garland doesn't have, doesn't,|sd
A|they don't, I don't know, they don't do anything like that|sd
A|or I, you know, I read those little slips that come in to your, utility bills or your, uh, garbage collection|sd
B|Right.|b
A|and they haven't, you know, talked about doing something like that|sd
B|Where does your friend go to to recycle?|qw
A|She lives in Garland|sd
A|and I'm not sure where, what she does.|sd
A|But she's, uh, oh she's very heavy in that|sd
A|and she takes her own bags to the grocery store|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|Uh, she has, I, I really don't think she has any paper products in her house.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|Uh, and just a lot of things I've learned off of her that, to start doing.|sd
A|And she does make a lot of sense.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|Just her whole house is like wow.|sd
B|I guess that's how it gets passed on. You know, when one person, you hear  from another person|sv
A|Yeah.|b
B|and then, uh, and then you, and then you pass it on.|sv
A|Yeah.|b
B|It seems to be catching on, uh, slowly but surely, I guess|sv
A|Yeah.|b
A|And, uh, my little boy has, watches a program that was really neat.|sd
A|I sat and watched him.|sd
A|You know the Barney?|qy
A|You know the little, I don't know if you know the little character Barney.|qy^d
B|Uh-huh.|ny
A|They had one, uh, on that kind of, type of thing|sd
A|and how children can, can do that|sd
A|and how to save water when you brush your teeth in water|sd
A|and it's really caught on|sd
A|and he's only four|sd
A|and he's really caught on.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Wow,|ba
B|that's cute.|sv
B|That's neat,|sv
B|yeah.|%
B|When you,|%
A|And keep the refrigerator door closed and that kind of thing.|sd
A|He's really caught on|sd
A|so that's really neat|sv
B|Well, when you start early, I guess,|sv
