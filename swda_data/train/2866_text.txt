well, Myrna, how do you get your news, news?
Uh, most of it is from the radio, uh, and also from the news programs that we watch in the afternoon.
Uh-huh.
Yeah.
We usually watch the local news and the, the, uh, national news both.
Uh-huh,
yeah,
I'm pretty much the same.
I, uh, I find that, uh,
I'm a graduate student
and I, I read a lot for school
and I find I have no patience to really read a newspaper because I just, I'm reading so much all the time.
And I really enjoy just sitting down and watching a news broadcast.
Well you can always get up and leave that
Uh-huh,
yeah, that's true.
Uh, I I just don't seem to have time to sit down and read the paper.
Either
by the time I get home from work, it's already, you know, time for the news to come on.
Uh-huh.
That's right,
yeah.
So, it's so much easier to sit there
and besides, I can be doing other things and still listen to the news.
Yeah,
that's right,
I, I agree.
That's,
a lot of times I eat while I'm uh, watching the news.
Yeah.
Yeah,
the same thing.
Is there any, uh,
what did you think about the coverage like over in the, uh, Persian Gulf?
I think they did a great job.
Yeah,
I thought so too,
it was, it, you know,
for a while when we were really interested, uh, we saw it all the time.
Some of the stations I guess carried it for twenty-four hours for a couple of days there
and then, you know, the special reports and the extended news coverage I thought was really good.
Uh-huh
Yeah.
And you could always find some channel that had something on
but you didn't necessarily have to watch the same thing all the time.
Yeah,
right,
yeah,
just news,
that's right,
yeah.
Yeah,
I noticed that one thing that, that T I did, you know, they had, uh, uh, they used to have, well they do have television monitors stationed throughout our buildings,
Uh-huh.
and they used to have a program called T News, and just updates of, of different things that were going on within T I.
Well when all the, the mess with, uh, uh, in the Persian Gulf came about they started carrying C N N.
Oh, yeah.
Well now, they have had so much good response from this, that T I now has C N N on all the time.
Uh-huh.
Huh, well that's great.
So, we can always run upstairs and, you know, get a quickie update on what's going on, if we really want to.
Uh-huh.
Yeah,
or if you have a break in the middle of the day, you take a coffee break you can always stay informed.
Yeah,
yeah
Yeah,
that's really good.
That's, um, I've found that when I, I don't have cable television anymore, uh, when I moved, went back to graduate school I just didn't have the money to buy, rent a cable T V line, or whatever, you know.
So I don't get C N N, uh, which was a big disappointment.
I used to watch,
that was my,
if I wasn't home,
I'm a college teacher
and sometimes I teach in the evening
so I'll miss the evening news.
And uh, you could always catch a good news program at eight o'clock or nine o'clock on C N N.
I think that's, that really has changed the way, uh, I look at the news.
Yes
Yeah,
we don't get it either,
we live out in the country,
Uh-huh.
and we just don't have it available out there where we are.
But when we did have it, uh, we, that's what we usually watched, was C N N
Uh-huh.
and sometimes we'd watch the weather stations.
Yeah,
that's, uh, same,
yeah,
that's,
when I had it, I, I watched it, you know, religiously for half an hour
and then you could go on, you know, to do what else you wanted to do.
Yeah.
Yeah
I find I, I read very little,
I don't even get a regular newspaper and, uh, because, uh, I, I don't drive that much,
I only live about a mile from where I go to school and work,
I, uh, I find I spend so little time in the in the car that I don't really listen to the radio, you know,
I don't,
so. So television is my main new source.
Oh, I get that too, because I, I'm in a van pool,
Uh-huh.
and I'm in the van, you know, uh, two hours a day
an.
Oh really,
to commute to work?
Yes,
yes.
Oh.
And in the, in the morning I try to sleep because it's, it's dark thirty.
But in, but in the afternoon, uh, I try to read
so I can, can, uh, not pay attention to what our driver is doing
Yeah,
I can,
the van pools I know that,
and I'm in the Baltimore, Washington area,
and I know they do van pool a lot here from some of the outer areas,
but if you want a nicer home, you know, beyond the suburbs, you know,
I,
that's necessary.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Are, are you in Baltimore itself?
I am, I am right outside Baltimore.
I am less than a mile from the Baltimore line.
Um.
And I go to a a campus of the University of Maryland that is just, less than a mile from my house.
So I, I'm actually in Baltimore,
yeah,
you could say I'm in Baltimore.
Yeah,
I have two kids over there.
Oh really,
in Baltimore?
well no,
in, in D C area.
Uh-huh.
Yeah
one works for the State Department
and, uh, uh, the other one is, uh, uh, her husband is in the Navy
and he's stationed at Bethesda
an.
Uh-huh,
oh that's, that's, that's a really nice area, Bethesda area.
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh,
it's, um, it's funny,
there's a big difference between Baltimore and Washington, even though they're so close.
There's only an hour, less than that between the two
but there is a big difference in things like property values
and, um, the closer you get to D C the more expensive it is.
Uh-huh.
And, um, the, the, uh, different slant.
Washington, it really is a, uh, uh, an international city, where Baltimore is hometown Baltimore.
You know, it, there's really, uh,
most people have relocated to the Washington area, you know.
Oh no,
I'd, I'd rather have Baltimore with the home town atmosphere.
Yeah,
that's,
I, I like it, I like it a little bit better, too.
It's interesting though, um, to meet different populations.
I, I'm just now being, uh, from Pittsburgh originally,
I'm just now meeting different populations like Chinese students and things
and I find that really interesting, you know, to imagine,
here is somebody that was in China, two years ago when all that was going on in, in, uh, Beijing.
You know, that, that's an interesting, uh, interesting perspective.
But I, I really
much, much like the hometown area,
yeah.
And I think that also goes,
it's funny,
you, you can watch different news.
I can watch Washington news or Baltimore news
and I really do watch Baltimore news.
You know, that really makes,
I don't really bother with the Washington station because I just, it's so far removed from what I'm interested in.
Well most of what they're talking about in Washington is, is the crime problems that they're having there.
Uh-huh,
yeah
they, in fact they just, it was just a big thing recently
they've had some terrible problems with Hispanics,
um, they had to impose a curfew that, uh, in two of the areas in, uh, in the Washington suburbs.
The mayor,
they've gotten rid of that really bad mayor and then, uh, brought in,
Uh-huh,
I heard about that.
Yeah,
and then came a woman that's um,
she's big in the Democratic party
so that's good,
so she has good national ties,
but she also was, um, something like a, uh, state auditor or something like that before this position.
She was a state auditor,
I guess she was an auditor general or something like that for the District of Columbia, at Washington.
And then she left that to get a position with the Democratic party
and now she ran for mayor,
so she's uh, fiscally she's pretty tight, and, uh, she's cleaning house
an, and it looks like hopefully she'll do a nice job, uh, for Washington, you know, which is,
you sort of feel sorry for a lot of the people there.
You know, from what I pick up on the news, uh, it's a difficult process, you know, to get rid of a, a bad mayor.
Yeah,
well I know both of my kids didn't want to live anywhere around the, the downtown areas,
Right.
they both moved way out.
Uh-huh,
yeah.
I think one of them lives in Germantown
and I can't remember where the other one lives.
Yeah,
but those are Germantown is a nice area.
Uh-huh,
yeah.
It's a nice area
It's, means they have to drive a little bit,
but,
Yeah,
well they might be car pooling too.
Do they car pool in?
Are they driven by themselves.
Uh, well now, I, I think he carpools,
Uh-huh.
Because he's got fairly regular hours since he came back,
but, uh, now my daughter they have probably been carpooling together, in fact,
because she had been called back up, active duty.
Uh-huh,
yeah.
And then she was supposed to have gotten out of active duty as of last Friday.
So, I haven't talked to them this weekend,
I don't know what the situation is,
but she was,
Uh-huh.
They didn't call you for Mother's Day?
We were gone
You weren't home?
Uh,
no,
we weren't home
but she had, she had called and left a message on our recorder
but I had that from all my kids except for one.
Yeah,
oh, that's good.
So.
Well I guess we should stop now.
Well I thank you for calling,
I have enjoyed it.
Uh-huh,
oh good.
I really do like this program because I get to talk to people from all over the United States,
yeah.
Uh, uh, so do I,
I've become very aware of different political views because some of the things we have to discuss are very politically motivated or whatever,
I, I really enjoyed it.
It's, it's so funny when you live in one part of the country you only see that perspective.
It's interesting to see the, the wider world,
so I enjoy it.
Hey, thanks a lot, and, and bye.
Thank you,
bye, bye.
