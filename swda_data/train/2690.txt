A|What are your favorite programs?|qw
B|Uh, it's kind of hard to put my finger on a, on a favorite T V program,|sd
B|however, uh, one that I've been watching for a number of years is DALLAS.|sd
B|And, uh, And, uh, it's going to be going off the air, uh, let's see, a week from a week from tonight.|sd
A|Oh, how funny.|ba
B|It's going to be its last show.|sd
B|So I've, I've kind of enjoyed watching over the years.|sd
B|I've been disappointed in it and also pleased in it.|sd
B|And, uh, I was, uh, greatly disappointed, uh, when I did move down to Plano to, uh, find out that the, uh, the, uh, great South Fork Ranch was really only a one bedroom house.|sd
A|I've seen the sign that goes to there.|sd
A|I've,|%
A|well I think I've seen it in the distance.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|But I have not even seen it.|sd
A|And I have not seen the program.|sd
B|Oh well, That's a shame.|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
A|So|%
A|And, and, uh, I know when we went to London, it was really funny.|sd
A|Uh, people recognized Dallas, Texas, by the, the Texas, uh, the, the cowboys and by that program.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Yes.|b
A|And that's, that's the two things they associate with Dallas, Texas.|sd
A|So,|%
A|I,|%
A|and I,|%
A|they asked me, uh,|sd
A|several times, several times they ask me, why are there two bridges?|sd
A|And I didn't know what they were talking about.|sd
A|It took me a long time, they're talking about the viaducts.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|Is that,|qy
A|that is right, isn't it?|qy
B|Yeah.|ny
A|Because they ask me, why are there two bridges going into Dallas?|sd
A|Darned if I know|sd
A|I was blank looking, you know.|sd
A|I felt really dumb.|sd
B|Well, it's, it's, uh,|sd
B|when you look at the, uh, you know, route seventy-five, coming down there. I mean, it's actually a bridge,|sd
B|but it's a bridge over top of roadway.|sd
B|There's no water there. I mean, uh,|sd
A|Well, there's water in the Trinity.|sd
A|I thought it was to, going to Oak Cliff over the Trinity.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
B|Well there's, there, uh,|%
B|well they,|%
B|I think when they open the show up they give you two different views of Dallas.|sd
A|Oh, do they?|bh
B|One from the east and one from the west.|sd
A|Uh.|b
B|And that's why.|sd
A|Oh, I see.|bk
B|But it kind of confuses people.|sd
B|But, uh, uh, I enjoy, uh, uh, a lot of different comedies.|sd
B|Um, I think it's mainly for an escape, um, you know, you, uh, my job is not the most thrilling in the world|sd
B|and, uh, I enjoy laughing and, uh, some of the shows that, uh, are on the air, some are just purely, you know, brain drainers.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And then there's other ones that, uh, deal with, uh, in a funny manner, uh, socially relevant things.|sv
B|And, uh, one show that comes to mind is like DESIGNING WOMEN. Uh,|sd
A|I think that is just a hoot.|sv
A|That's one of those few that I do watch when the television is on.|sd
A|My husband likes to watch T V.|sd
A|It's on.|sd
A|I usually read and watch T V.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Yeah.|b
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|But that's one of the few that I just actually watch.|sd
A|Because it's funny.|sd
B|Yes.|aa
A|I really enjoy that one.|sd
B|Yes.|aa
B|It, uh, it has been very entertaining|sv
B|and, and also, uh, the, the issues they deal with, uh, really tends to open, open your eyes as well as your mind to some of the problems.|sv
B|And, uh, I've, I've really enjoyed that one since it came on.|sd
B|Um, I don't like the politics surrounding the program though,|sd
B|but, I mean, other than that, you know, there seems to be a little in fighting going on between the producers and one of the actresses.|sd
B|But, uh,|%
B|and then, uh, I've kind of gotten hooked on P B S stuff, uh, public, uh, T V.|sd
B|Uh, I like things like NOVA and, uh, some of the, the special programs they come up with on nature and stuff.|sd
B|I just enjoy watching that stuff.|sd
A|Now, we watch a lot of those.|sd
A|Uh, and the ones that sometimes will hook me, to put down my book, will be the one, there was one, uh, recently about the Gettysburg Address.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And they wrapped a fictional story around it.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And I thought that was well done.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And, and it, it caught my attention.|sd
A|I wound up watching the whole thing.|sd
A|Uh, I guess the awards ceremonies, and there seems to be dozens of them per year.|sd
A|Maybe I've spent two minutes watching to see what they on and if they make a fool of themselves or not|sd
A|But they could take that whole collection|sd
A|and it would disappear|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|I, I, particularly take issue with those.|sv
A|I, I really dislike those.|sv
B|Well I'm one of those rare guys, who, I, I rarely ever sit down and watch a whole sporting event, um, if ever watch one.|sd
B|Uh, there's just not that much I'm, I'm interested in.|sd
B|Um, for a while, I, I, I watched some football,|sd
B|but I've just got too many more important things in my life now than to sit around and, and watch a baseball game.|sd
A|You know, my husband used to just be riveted to the Dallas Cowboys.|sd
A|And now, we're out running around,|sd
A|and if they're, if they're playing, he'll turn it on while we're in the car to see what the score is,|sd
A|and he'll listen.|sd
A|But, even I've said, hey look, you're fascinated with this, you sit and listen to the Cowboys.|sd
A|Let me run in here,|^q
A|and I'll do some things|^q
A|and I'll come back|^q
A|and you don't have to miss, he'll say, na, na, na.|sd
A|And he doesn't, he doesn't watch it.|sd
A|He like I say,|sd
A|if it's convenient he'll listen to it.|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|But he just doesn't watch them on T V like he used to.|sd
B|Well I think it was great when they were, you know, like world champs and they were doing real well.|sv
B|I, uh, I|%
B|personally, I, I came from the Washington area.|sd
B|And so I was a big Washington Redskins fan.|sd
A|Uh.|b
A|Oh, those people.|ba
A|Yeah|b
B|And, uh, when I came down to Dallas, it was, uh, you know, I found myself rooting for the home team.|sd
B|I, uh,|%
B|in fact I have a, uh, a baseball hat that was signed by Tony Dorsett and Hershel Walker the only year they played together on the Dallas Cowboys.|sd
A|Oh, how neat.|ba
A|Well, I actually got to go see them win in the Super Bowl when they went down to New Orleans.|sd
B|Oh, wow.|ba
A|And, I, I, I make the trip and did the whole New Orleans before the game and the game and everything|sd
A|and,  uh, that was, that was a lot of fun.|sd
A|But, I don't know, I haven't been as,|sd
A|I'll tell you what I love to watch. And this is not, this is rarely on television.|sd
A|But what is a lot of fun to go attend, is this arena football.|sd
B|Huh.|b
A|Yeah,|b
A|I like it so much better than straight football.|sd
B|No,|b
B|I haven't seen that.|sd
A|It, it doesn't,|%
A|it has a lot of different rules.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|The field is half the size|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and there's no,|sd
A|they can't call time and things like that.|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
A|It moves a lot faster.|sd
B|uh. Gee, I'll have to try to catch that sometime.|sd
B|It's,|%
A|Uh, again I think it may be on cable more than anything else.|sd
B|Yeah,|b
A|We  don't have cable.|sd
B|that's probably true.|aap_am
B|Yeah,|aa
B|we don't either.|sd
B|I, uh, I couldn't rationalize paying, you know,|sd
B|it's like if I pay for a movie channel, then I have watch what movies they want me to watch when they want me to watch them.|sd
B|And if I, you know, if I didn't use cable for anything else other than the basic, well I can get that for free.|sd
B|And well, I really don't need C N N, I see enough bad news all the time.|sd
B|I don't need to see more of it.|sd
B|So I, I've kind of, uh, rationalized that it's, it's probably a lot more economical for us to just go rent the movies we want to see.|sd
A|Well,|%
B|And of course when we were living in Texas, it was real convenient with Tom Thumb.|sd
A|Oh.|b
B|You know, having movies, uh, back then it was ninety-nine cents.|sd
B|I mean, go,|%
A|They're everywhere, they're on every corner.|sd
B|Yeah.|aa
A|Everything you've ever wanted to see.|sd
B|Um. You can see them a lot sooner than you can see them on any of the stations like H B O or Cinemax.|sd
A|Well, and I like to rent tapes because you can put the thing on hold if you get a telephone call or something like that.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|Or it becomes snack time for various reasons.|sd
A|You can put, you know,|sd
A|the only thing, this DANCE WITH WOLVES, I want to see it in a theater.|sd
B|Oh, yes.|aa
B|I do too.|aa
A|Because I understand that, that your, you'll lose fifty percent of it if you don't.|sd
B|Yeah.|aa
B|And I, uh, I've been trying to get my wife to go with me to go see it.|sd
B|She, she doesn't like going to movie theaters because usually they're dirty,|sd
B|and, uh, you know, she just doesn't like them.|sd
B|And, um, she doesn't think that she could sit still for three hours and watch the movie.|sd
B|And I've told her, you know, everybody I know that has seen it has said that the three hours go really quick.|sd
A|That's what I hear too.|aa
B|And, uh, so I'm, I'm hoping I can get her talked into it soon.|sd
A|Well, my husband smokes.|sd
A|He's one of the dinosaurs that still smokes.|sd
B|Um.|b
A|And you can't smoke in movie theaters.|sd
A|And that has really slowed down the forward progress of going to movies.|sd
A|But I haven't really cared up until this point.|sd
A|But I,|%
A|we are this weekend going to go see DANCE WITH WOLVES.|sd
A|It's,|%
A|that's it.|sd
A|We will do it.|sd
B|Um.|b
A|So,|%
B|That's great.|ba
A|Yeah,|aa
A|finally.|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
B|Yeah.|b
B|But as, as far as, uh, regular T V shows, I mean, I've got some, some shows that, that, that I would be afraid to admit to you that I've actually sat down and watched|sd
B|And then there's, there's others that, uh, uh, I wish I had time to see.|sd
B|It's like I enjoy watching CHEERS.|sd
B|It's very funny.|sv
B|Some of the things in it are mindless,|sv
B|but I, I just don't have time to watch it.|sd
B|Um, I think about the only night that I really sit in front of the T V set all night long probably is on Monday night.|sd
B|Because, um, I work so hard over the weekend, doing other things with the kids and stuff and going to work on Monday.|sd
B|Monday night I'm just worn out.|sd
B|So I kind of use it as the time to catch up on correspondence and, and look over things.|sd
B|And I can sit in front of the T V set and look at, you know, do, go through my mail and, and watch T V at the same time.|sd
A|Well, I tend,|sd
A|my job tends to be very demanding.|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And to sit down and to mindlessly either read or just mindlessly stare in absolute comfort isn't as bad as it used to,|sd
