B|Uh-huh.|b
A|How about you?|qo
A|Have you been in that situation yet?|qy
B|Uh, not for my parents.|ng

A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and that killed him|sd
A|Did it really?|bh
B|Well, yeah,|ny
B|kind of.|sd
B|Well, there was some other things involved|sd
B|but it,|%
B|before he was really active|sd
B|and the,|%
B|there was some,|sd
B|you know, he lost his drivers license|sd
B|and I couldn't get around and wasn't able to do some things|sd
B|and so we ended up just having to put him in a rest home.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|And he just kind of became a vegetable and died.|sd
A|Oh, no.|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
B|So  but that was a long time ago.|sd
A|That's sad.|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
A|Yeah.|b
B|That was, uh, back in like seventy-three.|sd
A|Oh, okay.|bd
B|So, uh, I think the way they did things were a lot different back then.|sv
A|I'm sure they were.|aa
A|Yeah.|aa
B|And, uh, my grandmother, his, his wife uh, we also put her in a rest home.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|She was in a rest home|sd
B|and then she was back out because she didn't really need to be there and, uh, had a physical, had a good physical therapist at that place|sd
B|and  they worked with her and got her walking and got her kind of taking care of herself|sd
A|Ah.|b
B|and so  she was able to come back home|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|and then she had to go back in a couple of times,|sd
A|Oh.|b
B|but mostly it was just because she kind of gave up.|sd
A|Um.|b
B|And they got her going again.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|So I guess as far as looking, do things with them and treat them, treat like they're ,|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Yeah.|b
A|And I'm sure it's, it's expensive.|sv
A|Yeah.|%
B|It, it is|aa
A|Yeah.|b
B|It is expensive.|sv
A|Yeah.|b
A|My, my grandmother is not in a nursing home|sd
A|but she's in a|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|oh they're like, uh, they're apartments for senior citizens|sd
B|Oh, uh-huh.|b
A|and she loves that because they arrange activities for them all day long|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and then they have, uh, where the bus picks them up and takes them where they need to go|sd
A|and she, she, she really does love that|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And she's just wondering well  what's going to happen to me|sd
B|When she can't take care of herself.|^2
A|and, and I,|%
A|you know, it's, I guess it's so normal to start to wonder about that even if she doesn't need that,|sd
A|but you know|qy
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Now|%
A|she's kind of asking questions about what, well what's going to happen, this can't last forever|sd
A|and so.|%
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Does she have a,|qy
B|is it like a kitchenette type apartment where she can fix her own food if she wants to|qy
A|Yeah.|ny
B|or she can go down to the cafeteria?|qrr
A|Yeah,|ny
A|she can|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|In fact, I ,|%
A|because I, I remember her, in her letters, telling me she'll go downstairs for coffee or something to eat,|sd
A|so I'm assuming it's something like that too.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|So.|%
B|Yeah,|b
B|I, I really like that concept.|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|They've, they have a few of those, well quite a few of those places like that here in Utah|sd
B|and, you know, couples can,|sd
B|you know, husband and wife can, can live there too or, or whatever.|sd
B|I,|%
B|and, and then, and yet they have their, their friendships and relationships and the, in you know, of getting together and eating together and all of that.|sd
A|Yeah,|b
A|yeah.|b
B|I, I think it really takes, uh, you know, looking more at the people than even really the facilities.|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|And she lives by herself too.|sd
A|She seems to like it.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And, uh, my husband's grandmother is,|sd
A|well, she lives, she lives in a house on her own|sd
A|and she doesn't really need the care or anything like that|sd
A|but, she has her own home|sd
A|and she's doing really well.|sd
A|I'm really proud of her.|sd
A|She's doing really well,|sd
A|so we haven't had to do anything,|sd
A|but then again, she has a lot of support|sd
A|so I mean, she's got her mother in town too and things like that|sd
B|Yeah.|b
B|Yes.|b
B|Well, I, I think that that's the thing that's a little bit scary, you know, a little bit tough about putting them in a rest home is it's, it's almost like|sv
B|that, you know, they say putting them out to pasture|sv
B|and some, some of the people that were there with my grandmother were really active.|sd
A|Yeah|b
B|They, they wanted to do things.|sv
B|They didn't, you know, they didn't want to go down and play bingo or, uh, you know, play with the oranges|sv
