A|So how do you get most of your current event information?|qw
B|Well, , see I'm going to school right now,|sd
B|and, uh,  while I'm working, I don't get a, I don't get a chance to read the paper a lot,|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and I don't watch T V as much really either, because, uh, my free time is kind of,|sd
B|and I do, like to do other stuff with it.|sd
A|Right.|b
B|While I'm at work sometimes, I, on the computer network um, I read the news sometimes,|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and that's kind of helpful.|sd
A|I would imagine going to college, though, your professors and different things,|sv
A|you keep up on what's going on.|sv
B|That's true,|aa
B|I mean, my roommates and stuff, you know people around me talk about it.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|And the people I work with are pretty, you know, up, up-to-date on that kind of stuff,|sd
B|so.|%
A|Right.|b
A|Well, I'm a housewife,|sd
A|I have three kids,|sd
A|and so  um, I get most of my information probably through just the news at six o'clock and then, um, talking with people and just hearing what's going on. .|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Yeah.|b
B|Do you watch, do you watch the network, like major network news,|qy
B|or do you watch like  the MACNEIL LEHRER HOUR?|qrr
A|Just the regular channel  just channel eight.|sd
B|Oh, really.|b
A|That's our channel here|sd
A|that's the, um, eyewitness news.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|So.|%
B|Oh, see channel, where I am channel eight's, um, like public T V,|sd
B|so it's kind of different.|sd
A|Oh, uh-huh.|b
A|Yeah.|b
B|I think, I think the, uh,|sv
B|I think a lot of the commentators on, like the major networks, like right, it's kind of appropriate right now because of the election stuff going on,|sv
B|but, um, it seems that, um, they kind of get to throw their opinions into how they, you know, report on the news.|sv
A|Right.|aa
A|And I think even in the elections, they choose who they're going to follow and who they're not,|sv
A|and basically you know, if a candidate can get them to follow, then the news will, you know, kind of publicize his name.|sv
B|Yeah.|b
B|Yeah,|aa
B|exactly.|aa
A|I don't think that the way I get the news is the right way to get it.|sv
A|I think you get a very lopsided picture of what's going on.|sv
B|Uh-huh,|b
B|because they can, they can only report on, I mean,|sv
B|they give each candidate perhaps, you know, ten second blurbs in which to, you know, to say, you, you just can't get a full picture of, you know their message unless you have time to sit down and and probably read something on it.|sv
A|Right.|b
A|Right.|aa
A|And the news, too, it just doesn't, um, cover that many stories,|sv
A|I mean, it just covers your basic, you know, violent crimes and, you know, and, and your catastrophes with weather and stuff,|sv
B|Yeah.|b
A|but other than that, you really don't know what's going on.|sv
B|Yeah.|b
A|Um, I will read our current letters that come out on elections|sd
A|and, I guess I do read that,|sd
A|and I do study who's running in our area,|sd
A|and I do study what's going on in the economy.|sd
A|It, you know,|%
A|and, I guess I do read other magazines, um, too, to get my information.|sd
B|What kind of, see,|qw
B|I subscribe to like SCIENCE NEWS,|sd
B|and that's, that's real good because it gives like a brief summary of, or like the updates, like of what's going on in science without getting into a lot of detail that would, you know, bog me down that I wouldn't know about|sd
A|Right.|b
B|but other than that I don't really read,|sd
B|I don't, I don't really subscribe to anything else.|sd
A|I used to read every month a READER'S DIGEST|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|but, um, now I guess I just have friends that clip articles|sd
A|or if I, you know, am interested in something, of course, during the when we were in war, I read up on that just a little in the newspaper to find out what was going on.|sd
B|Oh, yeah.|b
A|But a lot of the times, I, you know, I wish I had the time to read all the stories in the newspaper,|sd
A|but I just can't seem to find the time.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|If they put it out in a video, or on not a video but a cassette tape or something, where you could just listen to it I would do that while I was doing other things.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|But,|%
B|Well, I remember back during the, uh, during the war, everyone here at work always had the radio or the T V on, because that, they were going constantly with that stuff.|sd
A|Right.|b
B|But, uh.|%
A|Well, I, um, they even did a story on our news here in Texas on what people wanted to see more of,|sd
A|and people said that they wanted to see more on outside of Texas news.|sd
A|You know, we just don't want to hear every night all the killings that went on here in Dallas|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|that we want to hear what's going on with the economy, what's being done to help it, what's going on in other countries, what's, you know, just more information.|sd
B|If they reported every, if they reported every violent crime in Atlanta it would take, it would probably take the whole news hour|sv
A|Yeah.|b
B|But, uh.|%
A|Well, I guess we'll get pretty good news coverage in a couple of years when you host the, uh, summer olympics|qy^d
B|Oh, yeah,|ny
B|that's,|%
B|they start, already they're having like, um,|sd
B|in the newspaper they have a section, I think, every now and then, on the Olympics, you know,|sd
B|and they've got like a countdown,|sd
B|it's like sixteen hundred days or something.|sd
A|I know, we're trying to get tickets to it right now.|sd
B|Oh, really?|bh
A|Yeah.|ny
B|That's going to be crazy that time of year here.|sv
B|But, uh.|%
A|Yeah.|b
B|I can't believe, I mean,|sd
B|they're, they're stretching out the Olympic news for that much coverage over,|sd
B|I guess people want to hear about it.|sd
B|Also big in the news right now is the Braves, because they're, uh, they're in, you know, spring training or whatever|sd
A|Right,|b
A|right.|b
B|and they did so well last year.|sd
A|Yeah,|b
A|they spent a lot of time, that's another thing, they spend a long time on sports,|sd
A|and I think that, um, that's fine, I would like to see more time spent on other things.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|But.|%
B|It seems like,|sv
B|I don't know,|h
B|they way they do the newscasts, I wish they, they kind of separated it, you know,|sd
B|if you wanted to watch one thing you could turn to some channel for it|sd
B|but I don't have cable.|sd
