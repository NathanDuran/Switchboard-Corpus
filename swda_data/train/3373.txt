A|What is your favorite show?|qw
B|Well, I was just trying to think.|^h
B|When they called, I didn't have as much time to prepare for this as I did some of the others.|sd
B|Um, I love watching some of the, uh, new, new shows basically.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And we, uh, we subscribe to C N N|sd
B|and we took that,|sd
B|and we started watching a lot of those especially during the war or during anything kind of thing like the earthquake,|sd
B|and I have gotten stuck on a lot of this.|sd
B|The new shows and the stuff that comes on that, that it, you know,|sd
B|like the, uh, at night the discussion talk shows and things.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And we really haven't gotten a lot into the sitcoms that are current, uh, especially with the kids here because we have to kind of filter it before they get here.|sd
A|Sure.|b
B|We have little ones.|sd
B|Uh, we do let them watch NINE ONE ONE,|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and we think that's kind of informative to teach them,  how to handle things in situations.|sv
A|It really is.|aa
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|What do you watch?|qw
A|I watch just about anything,  but not a lot of,  T V.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|I mean I'll watch, you know, maybe a little while when I first get home in the evening.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And I usually watch, you know, the news|sd
A|and then I'll watch that HARD COPY or or that kind of thing, you know,|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|That's the same thing we do.|sd
A|and I like the NINE ONE ONE,  and UNSOLVED MYSTERIES.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Yeah,|b
B|that kind, that's the kind I like really more than,  the sitcoms.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|I haven't gotten,  into many of those.|sd
A|Now, I do,  like,|sd
A|my husband is really crazy about EVENING SHADE that comes on, on Monday evening.|sd
B|I have heard that's real good.|sd
A|And I,  uh,|%
B|That's,  Burt Reynolds, isn't it?|qy
A|Uh-huh.|ny
B|Yeah,|b
B|I've heard that.|sd
A|And I've got to where every Monday I rush around so I could sit and watch that with him because it's really funny.|sd
B|Now someone told me that|sd
B|and also, uh, I meant to be trying to pick up on MURPHY BROWN,  because they said that that was really good this season.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Well, his favorite night is Monday night|sd
A|so we've got to where we will sit,  and watch it on Monday night,|sd
B|You've got to yeah,|bf
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|because that and then that, uh, oh,|%
A|I can't even think of the name of it.|sd
A|Like I say I'm not,|sd
B|DESIGNING WOMEN is on that night,  too.|sd
A|Yeah,|b
A|and the one with the, the sergeant that married the woman with the kids, Sergeant McGillis .|sd
B|Huh, I don't even know.|sd
A|Sergeant, uh, MAJOR DAD.|sd
B|Oh, okay.|b
B|Now I,  we've never even seen that.|sd
A|Yeah,|b
A|that comes on right after, uh, the EVENING SHADE and then MURPHY BROWN,  and DESIGNING WOMEN.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|So we always, he watches that|sd
A|and I kind of I watch the first one then kind of sit in on the others,  as I can.|sd
B|On the others.|b^m
B|Well, you know, on Friday nights especially, we like to watch TWENTY TWENTY.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|Or, um,|%
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|It's kind of a competition on Thursdays between PRIME TIME and KNOTS LANDING.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|But, uh, we used to like KNOTS LANDING a lot.|sd
B|Oh, excuse me just a minute to someone in the|ad
B|The money is right there on the thing and the coupon.|t3
A|Well, you can't hardly watch KNOTS LANDING with the little kids around though.|sv
B|Oh, I know.|aa
B|That's the thing.|sd
B|And so,  we,|%
A|Except they,   probably are in bed,  by nine.|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Well, they are.|sd
B|In fact, on weeknights they are in bed by eight,|sd
B|but we have just gotten any more that where we just keep it off.|sd

A|I have picked up a show lately on Saturday night that I've really liked|sd
A|and that's SISTERS.|sd
A|Have you watched that?|qy
B|No,|nn
B|but I saw that advertised today|sd
B|and it sounds like it's not fluff.|sv
B|It sounds like it's good.|sv
A|It's really, you know, it's really pretty good.|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|I mean, it's kind of like, you know, um, soap opera I guess.|sv
B|Yeah,|b
B|that's what they said it was kind of,  a little more drama to it.|sd
A|But it's a,|%
A|So far it, I've watched it about three times now|sd
A|and it's really held my attention.|sd
A|It's been pretty good. Some,  pretty good acting.|sv
B|Well, and  and another one now that it's getting darker|sd
B|and you are wanting to cocoon more,|sv
B|that they said is excellent is the I'LL FLY AWAY and BROOKLYN BRIDGE.|sd
B|Some of these,  that are nostalgic.|sd
A|Now I watched,  BROOKLYN BRIDGE this week for the first time,|sd
B|Did you,  like it?|qy
A|but I haven't,|sd
A|I did.|na
A|I liked it.|sd

B|and,|%
A|Now I haven't seen I'LL FLY AWAY yet.|sd
B|I haven't seen it either.|sd
B|I think what I need to do is kind of read to see what is on these days because by the time we get the kids in bed at eight o'clock and then I get my bath it's, you know, it's almost too late to start,  something new.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|It's nearly,  too late for T V.|bf
B|Yeah.|aa
A|That's the way I am.|sd
A|I get in,  from work|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|and I'm tired|sd
A|and I sit and watch for a few minutes|sd
A|so I have to get up and do dinner,  and everything.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Yeah,|b
B|and then we've gotten to where we rent videos for weekend nights.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b

A|Yeah.|b
A|That's us.|sd
A|If we are home on the weekend, we always watch videos,|sd
A|so.|%
B|Yeah,|b
B|well, we do too.|sd
A|But there are some good shows on.|sv
A|I, I really probably should watch more of them than I do.|sv
B|Yeah.|b
A|But I like,|sd
A|I don't know|h
A|I, I'm always in to making things|sd
A|and,  And I don't just spend all my time,|sd
B|I don't know,|h
B|yeah.|%
B|There's a lot more to do with,  with your time when you get into it.|sv
A|and I, my husband, now he sits and watches T V constantly.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Well, my, my sister and them and her husband do on weekends.|sd
B|They don't have children yet,|sd
B|and they just turn it on when they walk in,|sd
B|they turn it off when they leave.|sd
A|Uh-huh,|b

A|I could be around here for hours by myself and never have it on.|sd
B|Yeah,|b
B|I understand.|ba
B|Same here.|sd
A|But, uh, but there are some really good new shows that I have enjoyed,|sd
A|and I'll have to watch that I'LL FLY AWAY this week.|sd
