A|Actually, I don't.|sd
B|Oh, really.|bh
A|No,|nn
A|uh, I, uh, when I was younger, I played a little bit|sd

A|Wow,|ba
A|that is real good.|sv
B|So, uh,|%
B|and he has been playing since we have been married for twenty two years.|sd

B|well I have had clubs for twenty years, you know.|sd
A|Wow,|ba
A|so you have been playing,|bf

B|So, I had to check that and, and, uh, talk about it.|sd
B|Well, have you played recently?|qy
A|No,|nn
A|actually, I don't even know if I checked that or not, to be perfectly honest. Um|sd
B|Oh|b

A|I don't know. Um.|h
B|Oh, that's okay.|bd
A|Yeah,|aa
A|I have not played in a long time.|sd
A|Um, when I was,|sd
A|about five or six years ago, my dad , who plays every now and then took me out with him|sd
A|and, and I basically, um, I had a horrible slice or hook,|sd
A|I forget which one it was.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|It wound up tossing the ball into the trees, virtually every time.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
B|Yeah,|b
B|the slice goes to the right|sd
B|and the hook goes to the left,|sd
B|I think.|h
A|Yes,|aa
A|I was slicing, actually.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|And, as it turns out, uh, I went and took some lessons for awhile, because I just, I would lose so many balls, and, uh, make it a horrible time for everybody.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
B|Yeah.|b
A|I went and took some lessons,|sd
A|and a I got a little bit better,|sd
A|but I but then I sort of, you know, went, went back to school and did not have time and this and that,|sd
A|and, and the only thing I do now is I occasionally go out to a driving range and hit a couple of balls and see what I can do.|sd
A|And I, And I still have this slice ,|sd
B|Yeah,|b
B|I think that's really a good thing to do.|sv

A|we play a par, a par three, nine hole course.|sd
A|Because, .|%
B|Oh, that's my favorite kind to play.|sd

A|Yeah.|b
B|and, in fact, I don't even like to use a driver,|sd
B|I use a three iron off the tee because, I have more control over it.|sd
A|Um.|%
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And, I can, I can just have better contact with the ball that way.|sd
B|So, I'm still using a three iron|sd

B|It's like he's trying so hard, it's not that flowing movement. You know.|sd
A|Right.|b
A|That's because he's probably doing what I do, worrying about, is my head straight, is my arm right,|sd
B|Yeah.|b
B|Yeah.|b
B|Or, how far he's going to hit it, I think, you know.|bf
A|oh yeah.|aa

B|I have to that, especially, even more so, with a short iron than a long you know, than with a driver or something.|sd
