Okay.
Hi Norma.
Hi.
Have you taken anything back lately, uh, that you've bought?
Well the only thing we've taken back recently are plants.  Shrubbery, that  were guaranteed
Well why?
and we had no problem with it.
Very good.
We got our got our money back.
Good.
Well do you think that, uh, consumer goods, goods are generally getting better, or worse in quality?
Well, I believe they're better.
I do too.
I believe about ten years ago that we went through a terrible time,
but I don't,
I, I believe that they're better now,
you know,
I think so.
I don't think they're shoddy, not as shoddy.
Electrical appliances I think are pretty good, reliable.
however, I didn't like it very well when the transmission went out on my car with sixty-three thousand miles on it.
Right
And I don't like it very well if, when my electric blanket that was only one year old went out at, uh, on one side.
Oh, did you return it?
No,
I had moved away.
No,
uh-huh.
I had taken the first one back.
I didn't think that it heated well enough.
It never did get anything but just moderately warm,
took it back
and, uh, the people told me well that's the way it's supposed to be
and I fell for it
and, uh, when I got this one it did, a it heated a little bit warmer
and then after one year it started heating only on one side.
Huh,
so either you or your husband can be warm but not both
Also, I took an iron back after having it only one year.
Oh.
Now I figure uh, anybody that is dumb enough to iron, needs to have an iron that will last a long time,
and one year of ironing only once a week is not long enough for it to last.
No,
huh-uh.
Did they replace it?
Well without even any question,
but I think it was the store.
Uh-huh.
Wal-Mart.
Wal-Mart,
I was going to say, it must have been Wal-Mart.
Yes
And, uh, well, have you been buying any clothes lately? Any new clothes?
I haven't bought any new
well the last thing I bought was a dress last Summer.
And the buttons turned on it over the winter.
The buttons tarnished slightly
and I have not gone back about it.
That was poor quality, I think.
I think it is too,
and it was an expensive dress.
I wondered if it weren't expensive,
Yes
it was.
and they should  have put buttons on it that would last forever.
That's right,
that's what I think too.
And one belt loop, the uh, you know, like the chain link, chain belt loop half of it raveled out.
Yes.
And that was, I believe a Leslie Faye dress
and it was, I think, over a hundred dollars.
You spent that much on your dresses?
Yeah,
I don't usually,
but I did that one.
You're really divulging very personal information.
But I think it should have been better than that, for that money, is what I mean.
Oh, of course, I do too.
Well I believe that we've been talking about five minutes.
Okay,
I think so.
And Norma, it is just wonderful to talk to you.
Good talking to you too,
I've enjoyed it
You are a good one to talk about consumer goods, because you keep up on it all the time.
Well, we'll be talking to you later.
Bye, bye.
Bye, bye.
