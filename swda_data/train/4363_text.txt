what's  your, uh,
Uh.
are you into the Cowboys?
Oh, God, no
Uh, no,
I'm not,
I haven't been,
I grew up in Dallas but I'm still not a Cowboys' man.
I like Philadelphia Eagles.
Oh, yeah?
Yeah.
Well, that  that's all  right.
That's  my favorite team,
so.
Uh,  now that Randall's coming back next season, I hope they'll be, do a little bit better.
They didn't do too bad last season.
Yeah.
But, I hope they can do better.
How about yourself?
Well, I don't know.
I kind of go back and forth, uh, depending on who's really hot and who's not.
I guess I'm kind of a fair weather fan in  a lot of respects.
Uh-huh.
But, uh, I guess if I have, uh, my druthers, I'd probably go for the Seattle Seahawks.
Oh,
I kind of like them.
Yeah.
That's another one of my favorites.
Yeah.
They're kind of,
They're not,  they're not my favorite totally.
But I do like them.
I like,
yeah.
Seahawks are good.
They,
now that Steve Largent is gone, I kind of lose a little bit for them
but you know, he,
Yeah.
To be honest with you, I, I probably watch, uh, college a little bit more than I do pro.
Really?
Yeah.
Huh.
I kind of like college  actually.
Quite a bit.
Yeah.
That's kind of,  that's kind of strange.
It's too much running for me in, in college football.
I like  I like  the pros.
Is it?
They do, you know,
it's more high tech,
more, you know, players are apt to act a little bit different when they, when their jobs and their, when it's a job and not just,  you know
Yeah,
yeah.
That could be.
when you're  getting paid millions to do it, you I think they take it to another level.
Yeah.
But I can see it's more, you know, grunted out, run the ball type.
College football is a little bit different
but,
Yeah.
You probably wouldn't like my favorite team in college then.
who's that?
Notre Dame
No.
I root for Nebraska quite a bit.
Nebraska
Yeah
there's a running team.
Yeah.
That, that, that's boring for me.
I, I'll take the passing teams any day.
Yeah.
But,
Well,  I can see, I can see definitely how you get into that.
I, to be honest with you, I find that too much running gets pretty boring as well
and.
Yeah.
It's just, it's four yards, three yards eight yards, tackle.
Right.
That's, you know, it gets kind of monotonous.
After awhile, I, I prefer forty, a nice forty yard flea flicker every now and then just, just  to  juice it up a little bit
Sure.
and  but,
Well,  I think they're starting to realize that.
A lot of the, like the big eight teams that used to run so much. I think they're starting to realize that they just can't compete anymore.
Yeah.
It's high dollar.
You know, it's all, it's all money now.
Even college  is all  can we get on T V
Right.
so.
Yeah.
That's,  that's,
So,  uh, what's
this World League is coming in?
Uh, that's getting ready to start up, right?
Right.
Yeah.
Have you followed that very much
or,
Uh, not really.
I, I don't think anything will ever take over the N F L.
I think it's basically, you know, it's, it's an institution.
Yeah.
It's like if we tried to start something to take over major league baseball.
It's just, I just, you know.
Yeah.
I mean, it, it, it can be, it can take over part of it.
But it's never going to be  the next,
Right.
It can  take over a small market  share
but nothing really,
Yeah.
it's going to take a little bit.
Some people are going to watch it
but it's not going to be wide spread super bowl and every Sunday afternoon or anything, you know.
Right.
It's just, it's never going to reach that, that standard
but,
Yeah.
I think I agree with you.
It's, it's kind of interesting to see, uh, to see their claim of, you know, like world football.
But, when in reality, it's really Americans playing somewhere else  you know
Yeah,
yeah.
It's kind of, it's kind of strange.
Uh, I guess we're the only ones, who take it that far.
Everybody else still nuts over soccer
but,
Yeah.
Actually, uh, I kind of like soccer.
I've  never really played it
Yeah?
but, uh, I like the idea.
It's, it's an interesting game to watch.
That and rugby.
I've like to watch, rugby every  now and then.
Yeah
or  Australian rules football.
That's,
Yeah,
whatever you want to call it there.
Yeah.
That's some brutal stuff there.
That's, that's worse than football as  far as violence I think.
Golly.
Those guys kill each other out there.
Rugby is something else.
Yeah, .
Yeah,
there's an element  there's definitely an element of stupidity in there somewhere
Yeah.
That's just wild.
That's why it's a a big college thing.
Yeah
Rugby is definitely big in college
because it's something a bunch of fraternity guys can get together and get a good beer buzz going and do
Right,
exactly
Yeah.
So, yeah,
I could see the feel for that.
But it's, it's pretty, it's fun to play.
Yeah.
I'll give it that.
It is fun to play.  If you don't value your  *listen--missing a word? very much.
You've played it then?
But, you know, I don't think rugby will ever be professional
but  it, it's, it's,
No I doubt it,  you know.
Not, at  least not in this country anyway.
No.
You can't stay healthy and do that.
That's a rough game.
Yeah.
It is.
But, uh, I don't know.
I don't know how my Eagles are going to do this year.
So you,
the, the Seahawks are an up and down kind of team.
They really are.
Yeah.
Yeah.
My, my, it's kind of odd. My roommate that I live with here, he's, uh, he's lived in Pennock, Minnesota. *two utts?
Do you know where that is?
Uh, no
I don't.
To tell you the truth, I'm,
It, it's a small town.
It's about two hours,
it's in like central Minnesota.
It's a couple of hours, uh, west of Minneapolis.
Okay.
But, uh,
To tell you the truth, I'm not even really from here.
You just live there now.
Yeah.
I'm, I'm up here for a year on an internship.
Uh-huh.
Well he's,
But I, I actually live in Florida.
Live in Florida.
Yeah.
Like the Seahawks
Well, you know, I  I mean, who, who   who  the heck is going to root for Tampa Bay, right
Hey,  I, I  I've only been to Philadelphia twice
and I, you know, I, I  still like,
Really,
really.
I mean,  I guess I could go for Miami
but I don't know.
Yeah,
but.
I'm from,
I root for Nebraska
so I'm, I don't have a real love for Miami anyway.
But, I don't know,
I, I guess, I get, into pretty much,
