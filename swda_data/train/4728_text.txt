I don't know what you drive now.
I mean, what do you drive now?
Uh, I have a Ford pickup
and, uh, the family car is a, uh, a Dodge Caravan. And, uh, because we have three kids and they're under thirteen
Oh, okay.
so, uh
Throw them in the back.
they sort of fit our requirement.
Yeah,
I have a, one of those, uh, pickups with the, uh,  seat  with a seat in the back.
Cab.
Oh, yeah?
And so they just fit in there.
When they get to be teenagers with long legs, it may not work.
Yeah
Right now,  I can, right now, I can throw them all in the back when we have room
and, uh and since I do a lot of projects, I throw things in the back
There you go.
and I kind of like having a pickup truck.
Yeah,
Actually,  I think of it as a as a car that'll last
Right,
yeah,
I know.
I like the way trucks are built
and I don't care about comfort.
So, I'm  pretty happy.
Yeah,
you're  looking at,
I got a Toyota Four Runner.
I wanted a truck that I, I wanted something that I could throw people in the back too,
so I got a Four Runner.
So I wouldn't hesitate to get another one.
I, I never buy new
so I wouldn't hesitate to get another used truck.
You're just like me.
I've never bought a new vehicle in my life.
And, uh, yeah,
I don't, I don't need to pay for the glitz.
I'll let somebody else, uh, have the showroom shine
No.
and I'll  pay for the rest of it.
Let somebody else break it in,
right
Right.
And, uh, the van we're
we might go again on a, on a van.
We, we could probably do with a, a, something just a little bit larger than a compact in a sedan next time.
I'm not sure.
Yeah.
We have to, we, we'll have to face it in a couple of years
but, uh,  I, I guess, we had a small Toyota wagon
Right.
and we were real happy with that because, uh, my, my second requirement after price is, uh, low maintenance.
Right.
And, uh, it certainly had that.
We didn't do much to it at all.
Yeah.
So.
Yeah,
my, my,
pretty much the same.
I, I got a, like I say I got one of those Toyota Four Runners
Uh-huh.
and, uh, it pretty much does everything I need it to.
I mean, it, it'll tow three thousand pounds
so I can tow everything
and it,
I can throw,
I've had eleven people in it before Believe it or not.
Uh-huh.
And, uh, it's real reliable,
I, I mean I've had it for almost four years now
and up until, oh, say two weeks ago, it had never had anything wrong with it.
Uh-huh.
And then, of course, two weeks ago, it decided,
I don't know,
it's the strangest, weirdest thing in the world,
but it blew a head gasket.
Uh-oh.
Didn't do any damage to it.
Uh, I caught  it real early.
How,
at how  at how many miles?
Uh, oh ninety-seven thousand.
Huh.
So it's not real early
You didn't overheat it?
No.
Never overheated it.
I smell, I smelled the, uh, I smelled the coolant
Uh-huh.
Went out and looked.
Saw it was, saw where it was coming from.
Drove it right to the shop and left it off.
Huh.
Well that was, ,
And that was it
because I, I have that
and then I have a, a Kawasaki motorcycle. Which is, actually, the, usually my preferred mode of transportation if I can take it and it's not raining.
Uh-huh.
Yeah.
I mean that's, that's sort of my, hobby though more than a vehicle.
It, it's a
I don't know,
people who buy motorcycles for transportation I think are kidding themselves
I have one colleague that, uh, commutes to work on one when it's not raining
and, uh, uh, he's a,
it's,
he's pretty conservative guy.
I don't think it's much of a sport for him. I guess, uh,
I know
but I bet you he really enjoys riding it.
I'm sure he does,
yeah.
Yeah.
So, you know,
when was the last time you took out, took your truck out just to, just to go driving?
Yeah.
No
And I go out twice a week on the bike, so. At least.  Just for  the enjoyment.
Yeah.
Uh .
Yeah
But, yeah,
I, I mean, the only thing I think I might get, a new car or, not necessarily a new car but, a, another car,
uh, I would consider going to a, a non, to a normal pickup rather than a, a covered pickup like the one I've got. Just because there's a lot of times I wished I had, just an open bed to throw stuff in.
Right.
I'm sure,  I'm sure that that's very,
I mean you got one.
It's, that's really convenient to be able to throw that sort of stuff in the back
and,
If I only had some place that I could store the, uh, camper top, I would have it off most of the time.
Right.
I really leave it on there just for, just to have it out of the way  because you put it on the ground it gets dirty.
To have it out of the way.
Right.
But, uh, they're solid.
Uh, trucks are built, uh, I mean,
I think they last a lot  longer than anything else.
They're  the only things Americans still know how to build
and, uh
Yeah,
yeah,
the trucks do.
Uh, even though, you know, the Jap, the little Jap trucks are, are good there too.
But so are the,
though I think the Chevies,
I don't think the
I don't like the Chevies as much as I like the Fords.
Yeah.
I think they, I think the Fords tend to last a little longer.  At  least until recently
Right.
I  I kind of like mine,
yeah,
so, mine's a Ford
A friend of mine just bought , bought like a year ago. It, it's a really nice truck.
I mean, I don't like Dodges at all
but one of the Dodges they have out now has a, uh, the Cummins turbo diesel on it.
Oh, I heard about that,
yes.
Oh,  it's beautiful.
Yeah.
That thing,  that thing will last  forever I mean ,
That,  that's a serious truck.
Oh, yeah,
that thing's, uh,
it's got a boat engine in it
Right,
this, uh,
I, I know a contractor who just got one of those.
Uh-huh.
He's pleased with it.
