B|That's right.|aa
B|How about your favorite team?|qw
A|Huh.|%
A|Well, last year it was Buffalo|sd
A|and I, I still try to keep up with Buffalo because they just, they just impressed me as being so efficient|sd
A|and they never score.|sd
A|They never blow out their opponents.|sd
A|They just score just enough points,|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and that really impressed me.|sd
A|But then down here I|%
A|is pretty close to New Orleans|sd
A|and I've been keeping up with the Saints a lot.|sd

B|Oh, my|ba
A|Those big piece of something came flaming, falling out of the roof and landed on the field|sd
A|so there's this big fire on the field|sd
A|and they were dumping the bucket and everything.|sd
B|Oh, I can't believe that.|ba
A|It was|sv
A|I mean, you just really can't tell what's going to happen.|sv
B|That's hilarious.|ba
A|I know.|b
A|It's like about two weeks ago I was watching the Saints.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And Anderson kicked a sixty yard field goal.|sd
B|Oh.|b
A|And it, it was beautiful, right down the middle.|sd
B|Oh, boy.|ba
B|He is tough,|sv
B|he has an incredible leg.|sv
A|He is.|aa
A|Yes.|aa
B|Well, do you think they're, they're going to be able to make it this year,  past the first playoff game?|qy
A|Uh I  I sure hope so.|sd
A|I'm not sure, I'm not sure who they play.|sd
A|Right now I've got it narrowed down to the top four teams.|sd
B|Who's that?|qw
A|It's pretty much going between Washington. They are undefeated. And, uh, Buffalo, New Orleans, and Chicago because Chicago has only lost twice|sd
B|Right.|b
A|and one of those was to Buffalo.|sd
A|And they beat the Saints.|sd
A|Their only time they lost.|sd
B|What do you think about, uh, Houston?|qo
A|Houston.|b^m
A|I saw Houston play this summer in Memphis.|^h
B|Oh, yeah?|bh
A|Yeah.|ny
A|Uh, from what I saw they were playing,|sv
A|when I was at the game we sat right on the front row,  right behind the Houston Oilers,|sd
B|Huh.|%
A|and from what I saw the game Houston, Houston impressed me a lot.|sd
B|Huh.|b
A|But my brother watched it on T V and said that Warren Moon was just having an off night,|sd
A|and if that was an off night I'd hate to see when he's on a good night.|sv
B|Oh, yeah,|b
B|he's he definitely, uh, is one of the best I think.|sv
A|He's,|%
A|Yeah,|b
A|the, their, their backfield is really impressive.|sv
A|Haywood and Drew Hill and|sd
B|Right.|b
A|they really impress me.|sd
B|Well, they squeaked out a game on Sunday.|sd
A|That's right.|aa
A|Who, who did they play?|qw
B|They played Dallas.|sd
A|Dallas,|b^m
A|that's right,|aa
B|They won,  in overtime.|sd
A|all because,|%
A|That's right.|aa
A|I remember that now.|sd
B|So that was,|%
B|I, I watched that game|sd
B|and, uh, that was, uh,|%
A|Do you have a favorite between those two?|qy
B|Well, because I'm right here in Dallas I, I kind of pull for Dallas.|na
A|Really?|bh
B|Yeah.|ny
B|Well, also Houston is, uh, in Pittsburgh's division|sd
B|so,  I'll almost always root against them.|sd
A|Well, that's true.|aa
A|I hate to say it|h
A|but I hate Dallas|sd
B|That's okay|sv
B|Well I, you know, I, I was never really a big Dallas fan until we moved here|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|and they just kind of grew on me.|sd
A|Yeah,|b
A|I imagine.|sv
A|That's the way,|%
A|I've never been a big Saints fan until the last year or two|sd
A|and they, they've actually started doing something.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
B|Yeah.|b
A|So, I've actually paid attention to them.|sd
B|Well|%
A|Well, do you know anything about the expansion teams they're thinking about bringing in?|qy
B|To tell you the truth I haven't paid too much attention to that.|^h
A|Really?|bh
B|Um, what cities are they looking at?|qw
A|Uh, right now I think this Memphis, they're, they're trying to get the teams.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And that's, that's where I was when I saw, uh,  Houston play.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|Saint Louis is trying to get a team.|sd
A|Uh, Baltimore is trying to get a team,|sd
A|and there's some other city.|sd
A|I'm wanting to say Raleigh|sv
A|but I'm not sure.|h
B|You know, I think you are right.|aa
B|I think it is Raleigh.|sv
A|Think so?|bh
B|I think I remember hearing that.|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Because I know they've got a football team|sd
A|but I think it might be them.|sv
B|That would be fun.|sv
B|I'd like to see some more teams get in.|sd
A|I would, definitely.|aa
A|I think they are supposed to put two in by either next year or the year after.|sd
A|And right now I think Memphis and, it's Memphis and I think Baltimore have a really good shot at it.|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|Because I know Saint Louis is much bigger than Memphis|sd
A|and when I went up there they were saying that Memphis sold more tickets than Saint Louis did.|sd
B|Oh, really?|bh
A|Yeah.|ny
A|It's like the Liberty Bowl or Liberty Stadium in Memphis holds about sixty-two,|sd
