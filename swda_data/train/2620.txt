A|All right,|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
A|I, I think our experience of camping is,|sv
A|I, I am the, the passive member,|sd
A|I get things ready and then I enjoy.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|Uh, because, my, my husband is a good camper|sd
A|and so they,|%
A|he manages the troops|sd
A|and they do the work|sd
A|and I have fun|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Well, uh, uh, your, you said your family was uh, all grown up now,|sd
B|how about when they were younger,|qo
B|did you go take them camping?|qy
A|That's when we camped the most.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|When,|%
A|I thinks it's a marvelous activity for younger families because, uh,  I, it seems like I would go through a period of time where I just, uh, was really overworked, you know,|sv
A|and, and getting out into nature and relaxing,  and having the family do a good share of the work, you know,|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and the part that I did was more fun than, uh, than labor because they did the, the running and toting chores and I just helped cook and kind of organize, you know.|sd
B|Yeah|b
B|even cooking over an open fire is a little more fun, isn't it.|qy
A|It is,|na
A|isn't it.|^g
A|It isn't.|ng
A|what kinds of things have you tried?|qw
A|Have you done, uh, uh, uh, the big pot cooking?|qy
B|Oh, oh, uh, well, it was really my ex who did the, the, uh, uh, the cooking back when we first started|no
B|and we found that the, you know, what was one, one great handy things was this, uh, uh, uh, hamburger helper. Because all you needed was a big frying pan,|sd
A|Oh, yeah.|b
A|Big frying|sd
B|you dumped everything in together|sd
B|and it was enough for all five of us, six of us.|sd
A|Oh, that's interesting.|ba
A|You know, interesting enough, uh, the food part was kind of, uh, important thing in our camping.|sd
A|Uh, when my oldest son, uh,|sd
A|always at the beginning I did all the shopping and everything.|sd
A|But the, the neat breakthrough was when my oldest son Mark took his, uh, uh, cooking merit badge in,|sd
A|and, and Mark was the kind of camper who ate beef stroganoff|sd
A|and, uh,  I mean, you know, he did it up really good|sd
B|Oh.|b
A|And so, uh, after he took that merit badge, he did all the shopping and preparing, getting ready for it.|sd
B|Well that's great.|ba
A|It was, it was a marvelous experience because after that, then all I had to do was, uh, follow the instructions, you know and do.|sd
A|And we did a lot of interesting kinds of things|sd
A|like I would take corn bread and, uh, cook a pan inside of a pan over a, over a camp, uh, stove.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And it works real good.|sd
A|It's like an oven.|sd
B|Well,  cooking was our secondary interest,|sd
A|Just put, uh, put a thing on it.|ad
B|I mean.|h
A|What did you like to do most?|qw
B|Well really just commune with nature.|sd
A|That's neat isn't it?|qy
B|We started out, uh,|sd
B|well we were living in Florida at the time|sd
B|and we, early in life, we discovered that six people all going on vacation gets to be very, very expensive.|sd
A|Right.|aa
A|I agree.|sd
B|So my ex decided, we're going to try camping|sd
B|and she went out one day on the spur of the moment and bought a tent.|sd
B|And that's how we got started.|sd
A|Huh.|b
B|We did it for years and years, uh.|sd
A|Well now in Florida, is is there are there times of the year when it's very comfortable to camp or is it always kind of hot.|qy
B|Well, uh,|arp_nd
B|yes and no.|no
B|I mean, um, in the winter time yes,|sd
B|it's, it gets kind of chilly or it can get chilly.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|But, uh, there's really no time of the year that you can't go.|sd
A|Oh, is that true?|qy
B|Uh,|%
A|Now, now we're, we're in Texas now|sd
A|and you're in Texas,|qy^d
A|right.|^g
B|Yes,|ny
B|I'm in Dallas.|sd
A|Okay, uh,|bk
A|we have not camped a great deal here because, uh, a good share of the time in the Summer time, it's too hot really to be very comfortable camping.|sd
B|Well, it just depends on where you go,|sd
B|for instance,  if you went down to the sea shore, it would be wonderful, a nice breeze blowing in from the water.|sv
A|I|%
A|Yeah,|b
A|yeah,|b
A|we have done that|sd
A|But, but we camped mostly,|sd
A|when the kids were little we were in, we were in New Jersey, and Uh, in, uh, Allendale and, uh, and, uh, Waldwick,|sd
A|it's just about twelve miles south of, the New York border.|sd
A|And we'd go up to the Adirondacks and camp|sd
A|and it was so, you know, pick your own, uh, blueberries and make blueberry pancakes for breakfast|sd
B|Oh yes,|aa
B|yes,|aa
A|Uh, also,|%
B|I  I come from up in that area,|sd
A|go ahead.|ad
B|I'm a New Yorker myself.|sd
A|Oh, are you?|bh
A|Where did you live?|qw
B|A little town called Tuckaho, over by White Plains.|sd
A|Oh, oh yeah,|b
A|I know that.|sd
A|I had a cousin who lived in White Plains,|sd
A|that's a, that's a neat area.|sv
A|But it's a, that is a particularly neat area for camping because,|sv
B|Well that I wouldn't know|sd
B|I left there when I was quite young.|sd
A|Yeah,|b
A|it is neat though because there are lots of lakes, fairly near by,|sv
A|you don't have to go very far.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And, uh, and there's, uh, a lot of trees, lot of mountains, and lot of, uh, hiking sort of things|sd
A|and, and we had, uh, collapsible boat which we, clipper, little clipper sail boat.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And so we would sail and, and, uh, did a lot of camping that way.|sd
B|Well, uh, me, I outgrew, uh, sleeping bags and, uh, tents,|sd
B|and I now have a motor home.|sd
A|Oh, do you.|bh
A|We've gotten out a time or two on a rented basis|sd
A|and it's fun, too, I think.|sv
B|Well I live in mine.|sd
A|Do you?|bh
B|Yes.|ny
A|That's neat,|sv
A|so you kind of, uh, uh, an everyday camper|qy^d
B|Uh, well, yes|ny

A|or,|%
B|well just me and my dog.|h
A|You and your dog, huh,|bf
B|Yeah.|aa
A|Hey,|ba
A|that sounds great.|ba
A|Well, we don't, we don't camp quite as much as we used to,|sd
A|but, uh, I still think it's a great way to spend a time with your family,  and enjoy nature and, uh, kind of wipe out the stress of everyday life.|sv
B|Oh yes,|aa
B|definitely.|aa
A|I'd always,|%
B|Nothing like the fresh outdoors.|bf
A|right,|aa
A|I'd always come home just relaxed and, uh, comfortable and ready to go at it again,|sd
