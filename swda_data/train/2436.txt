B|Well I haven't had too much of a chance to watch T V lately.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|So probably everything I going to say is kind of dated.|sd
A|Well, I can understand that.|ba
A|It's that time of the year.|sv
B|Yeah.|b
A|We just, my wife and I just recently moved into our house.|sd
A|So we're spend a lot of time on the house and out in the yard and things. But. Um, like to keep up to date too.|sd
B|Oh.|b
B|Yeah.|b
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|I guess, in the,|%
A|since I got out of college, which was about five years ago, my T V viewing started to tend more towards, uh, documentary, news programs, things like that.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|Something that's going to keep mu up to date.|sd
A|I've kind of, kind of gotten away from, uh, being a series watcher, having to keep up to date with, uh,|sd
B|Oh, yeah.|b
B|I think when you're in college you kind of, you have more of a regular schedule in terms of, you can watch every week.|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Yeah,|aa
A|that makes a big difference.|sv
B|So, yeah,|aa
B|I, I used to,|%
B|when my kids were real little and I was home, I watched,|sd
B|where I was home where I watched things on a more regular basis.|sd
B|But right now, the last things I watched regularly was THIRTY SOMETHING when it first came out.|sd
A|Okay.|b
B|Did you all ever watch that?|qy
A|I, yeah, I started, too, and, uh kind of, kind of worked away from that.|na
B|Yeah.|b
B|Yeah.|b
A|I, I have a hard time sticking with something like, like on T V, because, it, like, it gets real aggravating if you miss it, for a week or two.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|You feel kind of left out|sv
B|Right,|aa
B|right.|aa
A|But, um, right.|b^m
B|I know,|aa
B|but I tell you what, um,|^h
B|we're really strict with our kids about television,|sd
B|and one night, couple weeks ago, it was just happened that we were exhausted|sd
B|and they wanted to watch,|sd
B|and we said okay, well we'll sit down|sd
B|and we'll, you know, look at what you want to see.|^q
B|Let's just turn it on and see what's on.|^q
B|We could not find anything that had any kind of redeeming value in it.|sd
A|I believe that.|ba
B|So, you know, it was prime time,|sd
B|it was, what, seven thirty, eight o'clock on a week night|sd
A|Uh-huh,|b
A|uh-huh.|b
B|and we have cable,|sd
B|and there wasn't anything on any channel,|sd
B|and the stuff that was on the prime, the networks, you know, A B C, N B C, C B S, was,|sd
B|it was just, um, dribble|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|you know, I mean, it wasn't even funny|sd
A|That's right.|aa
B|it wasn't creative,|sd
B|it, it was the worst I've seen.|sd
B|I mean, I have not watched prime time, week night T V, I guess in a real long time because I was shocked.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
A|I know exactly how you feel.|ba
B|You know what I'm saying.|qh
A|That's right.|aa
A|I, uh, when I first moved down here, moved into the apartment and got cable, and I guess I sort of, kind of became numb.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|Nothing surprised me any more seeing it on the T V, you know.|sd
A|And then all of a sudden, I started paying, paying attention to soft voices in the network T V again, once in a while.|sd
B|Right.|b
A|Right now we don't have cable.|sd
B|Right.|b
A|And it's surprising how much it's changed|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|the whole moral situation, everything, is just gone one whole complete direction different.|sv
A|And we don't have any kids yet,|sd
A|but I feel the same way.|sd
A|It's really tough to find something that's going to be good and interesting for the kids. Even, even cartoons, um|sv
B|Right.|b
B|Oh.|b
A|you know, you watch some of the cartoons,|sv
A|and kids aren't, aren't even going to understand half the humor that's in there.|sv
B|Yeah.|b
A|It's,|%
A|none of it's probably damaging, lot of times.|sv
B|Right,|aa
B|it's just, it's just, uh, like a necessary evil.|sv
B|I mean, when we, when our children were younger, when they were like four years old, three years old, five years old, we just had Sesame Street|sd
B|and that was about it, you know.|sd
A|Right,|b
A|right.|b
B|But now, in order to seem, you know, humane and normal, we do allow them to watch cartoons and stuff.|sv
A|Oh, yeah,|aa
A|yeah.|aa
B|But it's, just one of those things, you know,|sv
B|you have to shut your eyes or not listen or something, because those drive you crazy, if you're, if you're in the room.|sv
B|So, But it's such a shame, because it could be so good.|sv
A|That's right.|aa
B|I don't understand why, first of all, the public puts up with it. Second of all, why the networks think that, you know, we enjoy that kind of stuff.|sv
A|Well, that's true.|aa
B|It's hard to believe that nobody can be any more creative than that.|sv
B|That can't be the problem.|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|It must be the marketing pressures,|sv
B|and, you know, their demographic studies that they do that show, you know, that everybody's I Q has dropped dramatically or something.|sv
A|I'm glad you said it|sd
A|and I didn't have to.|sd
A|But that, that, that's the,|%
A|I feel the exact same way.|sd
A|I sit, I sit and watch some shows,|sd
A|and I'm embarrassed for the people that are even involved in the show.|sd
B|I know.|ba
A|You know, why do you do this to yourself?|qh
B|Why do you do this?|qh
A|Yeah.|b
B|I know,|aa
B|I'm trying to think if there's anything I do,|sd
B|you, like, uh, I like stuff that's on Great Performances,|sd
B|and, I, we used to watch mystery quite a bit and things like that.|sd
A|Okay.|b
B|Stuff I guess that mostly public, on public T V.|sd
A|Right.|b
B|As a matter of fact, you know when I was a kid, excuse me, my parents used to have,|sd
B|we had this rule in our house for every hour of regular T V that we watched, we had to watch an hour of public T V|sd
A|Now there's an idea.|ba
B|That was just the rule.|sd
B|And if they saw us watching the, something,|sd
B|they'd say, all right, what did you see on WHAT'S NEW,|sd
B|or there was some other,|sd
B|the children's program I think at the time was called WHAT'S NEW.|sd
A|Okay,|b
A|yeah.|b
B|So we had to give a little oral report before we could watch our program.|sd
A|Yeah,|b
A|yeah.|b
A|That's pretty good.|ba
B|Do you, do you watch sports on T V?|qy
B|Are you a sports fan?|qy
A|I can't handle it very long.|no
B|Yeah|b
A|I, I mean, I'm, I'm a sports fan,|na
A|but it's, well, it's kind of, it's kind of like reading magazines any more.|sv
A|If half of the time wasn't spent watching commercials, it probably wouldn't be so bad.|sv
B|Right,|b
B|yeah.|b
A|But, uh, it, it's,|%
A|you're missing an awful lot.|sv
B|Yeah.|b
A|I'd rather, personally rather watch, see a game on T V than fight the crowds at the stadium.|sd
A|but uh,|%
B|Yeah,|b
B|that's true,|aa
B|the traffic.|%
A|But, uh, no,|nn
B|Uh.|b
A|I don't sit down,|sd
A|I'll sit down for the big games, the Super Bowl, and the championship you know, things like that.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|But I don't follow any team.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|I check the scores the next morning,|sd
A|and I know how everybody's doing,|sd
A|and that suffices me.|sd
A|But, I like, I like good comedy, good humor once in a while.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
B|Yeah,|b
B|I, I enjoy that,|sd
B|but what do you, where do you do you get that|qw
B|You don't have cable now,|qy^d
B|I was going to say they have a comedy channel now.|sd
B|But again you're in a situation where you're watching mostly, uh, commercials,|sv
B|and then you're, you know, trying to pass the time to wait until the next comedian comes up.|sv
B|You know what I did.|qh
B|There was a time there where I could tape things|sd
B|and then I'd fast forward through the commercials.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|Saved a lot of time that way.|sd
A|Yeah,|aa
A|it works,|aa
A|you bet,|ba
A|yeah.|aa
B|But, that takes too much planning.|sv
A|Yeah,|aa
A|no,|ar
A|I don't know,|h
A|if there's any, any series that I pay attention to, I try to watch CHEERS once in a while.|sd
B|Now that, yeah, is that still real good.|sv
B|It used to be real good.|sv
B|But.|%
A|Yeah,|aa
A|it is.|aa
B|Is it.|aa
A|In fact, it's, I think it's on tonight|sd
B|Oh|b
A|I just got in from outside,|sd
A|so I|%
B|Oh, okay.|b
A|so I'm kind of out of it.|sd
A|Things like that,|sd
A|and I consider that fairly intelligent humor. You know.|sv
B|Yeah.|b
B|Yeah.|b
A|You can tell,|sv
A|they pick up the words every once in a while.|sv
B|Right,|aa
B|right.|aa
B|Isn't it such a long running program.|qy^d
A|Yeah.|ny
B|Yeah,|b^m
B|they do have a good, they do have good writers for that.|sv
B|Oh, that makes me think,|sd
B|do you watch SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE at all?|qy
A|I try to.|na
B|Yeah,|b
B|we try to stay up, too|sd
A|Yeah|b
B|It's getting harder and harder.|sd
B|Ten years ago wasn't so hard to stay up.|sv
A|Yeah,|aa
A|you know, it was, it was just automatic, too,|sv
A|no matter where you were you stopped and sat down and watched it.|sv
A|I think it's come around again.|sv
A|It's gone through cycles.|sv
B|Yeah,|aa
B|it was,|%
B|we stopped watching for a couple of years in the middle there,|sd
B|but we started watching again.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|But it's real different show than it was when it started.|sv
A|Yeah.|b
B|It's funny now,|sv
B|and it's better,|sv
B|but it's real different than what it used to be.|sv
A|That's right.|aa
A|That's right.|aa
B|But you can't be so, can't be outrageous.|sv
A|Right.|b
B|You know, if you keep that same format.|sv
B|There's only so long that you can be outrageous.|sv
B|So,|%
A|Yeah,|aa
A|that's for sure, that is for sure.|ba
A|Well, I guess there are a few things around still|sv
A|but,|%
B|Yeah,|aa
B|but you have to hunt hard for them.|sv
A|Sounds like you pretty much agree.|qy^d
B|Yeah,|ny
B|I guess so.|sd
A|Well.|%
B|Well.|%
