Well I haven't had too much of a chance to watch T V lately.
Yeah.
So probably everything I going to say is kind of dated.
Well, I can understand that.
It's that time of the year.
Yeah.
We just, my wife and I just recently moved into our house.
So we're spend a lot of time on the house and out in the yard and things. But. Um, like to keep up to date too.
Oh.
Yeah.
Uh-huh.
I guess, in the,
since I got out of college, which was about five years ago, my T V viewing started to tend more towards, uh, documentary, news programs, things like that.
Uh-huh.
Something that's going to keep mu up to date.
I've kind of, kind of gotten away from, uh, being a series watcher, having to keep up to date with, uh,
Oh, yeah.
I think when you're in college you kind of, you have more of a regular schedule in terms of, you can watch every week.
Uh-huh.
Yeah,
that makes a big difference.
So, yeah,
I, I used to,
when my kids were real little and I was home, I watched,
where I was home where I watched things on a more regular basis.
But right now, the last things I watched regularly was THIRTY SOMETHING when it first came out.
Okay.
Did you all ever watch that?
I, yeah, I started, too, and, uh kind of, kind of worked away from that.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I, I have a hard time sticking with something like, like on T V, because, it, like, it gets real aggravating if you miss it, for a week or two.
Yeah.
You feel kind of left out
Right,
right.
But, um, right.
I know,
but I tell you what, um,
we're really strict with our kids about television,
and one night, couple weeks ago, it was just happened that we were exhausted
and they wanted to watch,
and we said okay, well we'll sit down
and we'll, you know, look at what you want to see.
Let's just turn it on and see what's on.
We could not find anything that had any kind of redeeming value in it.
I believe that.
So, you know, it was prime time,
it was, what, seven thirty, eight o'clock on a week night
Uh-huh,
uh-huh.
and we have cable,
and there wasn't anything on any channel,
and the stuff that was on the prime, the networks, you know, A B C, N B C, C B S, was,
it was just, um, dribble
Yeah.
you know, I mean, it wasn't even funny
That's right.
it wasn't creative,
it, it was the worst I've seen.
I mean, I have not watched prime time, week night T V, I guess in a real long time because I was shocked.
Yeah.
I know exactly how you feel.
You know what I'm saying.
That's right.
I, uh, when I first moved down here, moved into the apartment and got cable, and I guess I sort of, kind of became numb.
Uh-huh.
Nothing surprised me any more seeing it on the T V, you know.
And then all of a sudden, I started paying, paying attention to soft voices in the network T V again, once in a while.
Right.
Right now we don't have cable.
Right.
And it's surprising how much it's changed
Uh-huh.
the whole moral situation, everything, is just gone one whole complete direction different.
And we don't have any kids yet,
but I feel the same way.
It's really tough to find something that's going to be good and interesting for the kids. Even, even cartoons, um
Right.
Oh.
you know, you watch some of the cartoons,
and kids aren't, aren't even going to understand half the humor that's in there.
Yeah.
It's,
none of it's probably damaging, lot of times.
Right,
it's just, it's just, uh, like a necessary evil.
I mean, when we, when our children were younger, when they were like four years old, three years old, five years old, we just had Sesame Street
and that was about it, you know.
Right,
right.
But now, in order to seem, you know, humane and normal, we do allow them to watch cartoons and stuff.
Oh, yeah,
yeah.
But it's, just one of those things, you know,
you have to shut your eyes or not listen or something, because those drive you crazy, if you're, if you're in the room.
So, But it's such a shame, because it could be so good.
That's right.
I don't understand why, first of all, the public puts up with it. Second of all, why the networks think that, you know, we enjoy that kind of stuff.
Well, that's true.
It's hard to believe that nobody can be any more creative than that.
That can't be the problem.
Uh-huh.
It must be the marketing pressures,
and, you know, their demographic studies that they do that show, you know, that everybody's I Q has dropped dramatically or something.
I'm glad you said it
and I didn't have to.
But that, that, that's the,
I feel the exact same way.
I sit, I sit and watch some shows,
and I'm embarrassed for the people that are even involved in the show.
I know.
You know, why do you do this to yourself?
Why do you do this?
Yeah.
I know,
I'm trying to think if there's anything I do,
you, like, uh, I like stuff that's on Great Performances,
and, I, we used to watch mystery quite a bit and things like that.
Okay.
Stuff I guess that mostly public, on public T V.
Right.
As a matter of fact, you know when I was a kid, excuse me, my parents used to have,
we had this rule in our house for every hour of regular T V that we watched, we had to watch an hour of public T V
Now there's an idea.
That was just the rule.
And if they saw us watching the, something,
they'd say, all right, what did you see on WHAT'S NEW,
or there was some other,
the children's program I think at the time was called WHAT'S NEW.
Okay,
yeah.
So we had to give a little oral report before we could watch our program.
Yeah,
yeah.
That's pretty good.
Do you, do you watch sports on T V?
Are you a sports fan?
I can't handle it very long.
Yeah
I, I mean, I'm, I'm a sports fan,
but it's, well, it's kind of, it's kind of like reading magazines any more.
If half of the time wasn't spent watching commercials, it probably wouldn't be so bad.
Right,
yeah.
But, uh, it, it's,
you're missing an awful lot.
Yeah.
I'd rather, personally rather watch, see a game on T V than fight the crowds at the stadium.
but uh,
Yeah,
that's true,
the traffic.
But, uh,  no,
Uh.
I don't sit down,
I'll sit down for the big games, the Super Bowl, and the championship you know, things like that.
Yeah.
But I don't follow any team.
Uh-huh.
I check the scores the next morning,
and I know how everybody's doing,
and that suffices me.
But, I like, I like good comedy, good humor once in a while.
Yeah.
Yeah,
I, I enjoy that,
but what do you, where do you do you get that
You don't have cable now,
I was going to say they have a comedy channel now.
But again you're in a situation where you're watching mostly, uh, commercials,
and then you're, you know, trying to pass the time to wait until the next comedian comes up.
You know what I did.
There was a time there where I could tape things
and then I'd fast forward through the commercials.
Uh-huh.
Saved a lot of time that way.
Yeah,
it works,
you bet,
yeah.
But, that takes too much planning.
Yeah,
no,
I don't know,
if there's any, any series that I pay attention to, I try to watch CHEERS once in a while.
Now that, yeah, is that still real good.
It used to be real good.
But.
Yeah,
it is.
Is it.
In fact, it's, I think it's on tonight
Oh
I just got in from outside,
so I
Oh, okay.
so I'm kind of out of it.
Things like that,
and I consider that fairly intelligent humor. You know.
Yeah.
Yeah.
You can tell,
they pick up the words every once in a while.
Right,
right.
Isn't it such a long running program.
Yeah.
Yeah,
they do have a good, they do have good writers for that.
Oh, that makes me think,
do you watch SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE at all?
I try to.
Yeah,
we try to stay up, too
Yeah
It's getting harder and harder.
Ten years ago wasn't so hard to stay up.
Yeah,
you know, it was, it was just automatic, too,
no matter where you were you stopped and sat down and watched it.
I think it's come around again.
It's gone through cycles.
Yeah,
it was,
we stopped watching for a couple of years in the middle there,
but we started watching again.
Uh-huh.
But it's real different show than it was when it started.
Yeah.
It's funny now,
and it's better,
but it's real different than what it used to be.
That's right.
That's right.
But you can't be so, can't be outrageous.
Right.
You know, if you keep that same format.
There's only so long that you can be outrageous.
So,
Yeah,
that's for sure, that is for sure.
Well, I guess there are a few things around still
but,
Yeah,
but you have to hunt hard for them.
Sounds like you pretty much agree.
Yeah,
I guess so.
Well.
Well.
Been, uh, good talking to you.
Yeah,
good talking to you.
Okay.
Take care.
You too.
Bye.
Bye.
