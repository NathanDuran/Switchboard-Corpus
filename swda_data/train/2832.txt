B|Also I lived in Georgia for about four years,|sd
B|so the, uh,|%

A|Uh-huh.|b
B|Anyway, my home is, um, I guess it's about twenty-five hundred square foot|sd
B|and I have, uh, four bedrooms at the present.|sd
B|We're busting out walls and things like that.|sd
A|That's what I want to do.|sd
A|How many kids do you have?|qw

A|Do you have enough bedroom space, then?|qy
B|Yeah,|ny
B|we'll have enough bedroom space,|sd
B|it's,|%
B|we're rearranging our house because the bedrooms are kind of small.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And so, we're going to enlarge our master bedroom and take out a couple of walls and enlarge it. And then shuffle the rooms around a little bit.|sd
A|That's kind of like what we'd like to do.|sd
A|We just had a baby a couple months ago|sd
A|and we've got a den,|sd
A|it's more or less a spare room.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|We rarely go in there, except for to play chess.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|We want to make that a bedroom for my stepdaughter and my daughter|sd
A|and, uh, we need the one extra room.|sd
A|Like, like you said, our rooms are too the bedrooms are too small,|sd
A|the living room and kitchen are huge,|sd
B|Right.|b
A|but the bedrooms are too small.|sd
A|Where you've got to leave the furniture just one certain way, you can't rearrange it at all.|sd
B|Right,|b
B|there's they, uh,|%
B|I know what you're saying there,|sd
B|ours is the same|sd
B|and they tend to put windows in the strangest places.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|You know we have windows in our bathrooms which really makes it difficult for,|sd
A|Yeah,|b
A|we've got two great big windows in our back bathroom.|sd
B|Uh-huh,|b
B|you're kind of limited in what you can do there and everything,|sd
B|so.|%
A|No privacy.|sd
B|No,|aa
B|we don't have a lot of that,|sd
B|yeah.|%
A|Well, we've got at least two windows on every wall in the house.|sd
A|It,|%
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|I'd hate to clean these windows,|sd
A|I really would.|sd
B|I figured I'm going to have to hire somebody to remove our windows and put new ones in that are easier to clean.|sd
B|Ours are the double pane|sd
B|and you can't really clean them on the inside, you know.|sd
A|Ours are those too,|sd
A|yeah.|b
A|You must live in an older home too then.|sd
B|Right,|aa
B|I do,|sd
B|the house is about, um, I'd say almost thirty years old.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|So it's not a new home,|sd
B|it's, it's seen some wear and tear. You know.|sd
A|Ours has too.|sd
A|When we moved in the man that sold it to us had said that he remodeled it,|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and he did it hisself,|sd
A|so most of that, by now, is falling apart.|sd
B|Oh.|b
A|You know, well I mean, it's not just horrible,|sd
A|but like this tile's come loose off the wall,|sd
A|the whole bathroom is covered from ceiling to foot in tile|sd
A|and I don't like that at all.|sd
B|Um, that is awful.|ba
A|With that, uh, the great big tiles, square tiles like, that you put on the floor,  the, the huge one.|sd
B|Uh-huh,|b
B|he did it in that?|qy
A|Yeah,|ny
A|instead of wallpaper.|sd
A|I wouldn't mind it if it was like short tiles,|sd
A|for that you put,|sd
B|The normal tiles,|^2
B|right.|b
A|right|aa
A|that you put around a bathtub,|sd
A|that would be prettier.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|But this looks like floor covering on the wall.|sd
A|It just doesn't look good.|sd
B|Oh, and also they're very heavy|sd
B|and so they tend to come off a whole lot easier.|sd
A|Right,|b
A|there's one big one that has come off|sd
A|and short of putting nails through it, we can't get it back on,|sd
A|so.|%
B|Um.|b
A|And he rewired the house|sd
A|and it's shorting out here and there,|sd
A|and|%
B|Oh, wow,|ba
B|I,|%
B|that's one of the things we've been fortunate with, is our, uh, wiring is okay.|sd
B|We don't have a, we don't have enough power,|sd
B|um, or our breakers aren't, aren't powerful enough to take, to, to really help with the load in the house.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|I mean we need to redo some, rewiring ourselves|sd
B|but our plumbing is awful.|sd
B|There is there is a shut off valve that's outside that doesn't work,|sd
A|Um.|b
B|and there's no other real shut off valves inside the house,|sd
B|so if something breaks, we have to shut it off from the main, in the street,  you know,|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|and, oh, it's, it can be really bizarre.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|And we never know where it's going to flood.|sd
A|We've got power surges on the west side of our house.|sd
A|We've got our stereo hooked up.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|Well that,|%
A|the power makes it run.|sd
A|It's never ran,|sd
A|it's always ran just fine, the clock and stuff.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|But it runs about ten minutes fast, except for about a month, for about a month the, the clock ran normal.|sd
B|Um.|b
A|And then the power went off again,|sd
A|lightning or something knocked it out|sd
A|and we hooked it back up|sd
A|and now it's running ten or fifteen minutes fast again.|sd
B|Um.|b
A|But on the east side of the house it runs fine.|sd
B|Oh boy, you do have a strange wiring problem there.|ba
A|He put new wiring in,|sd
A|it's all new wiring up in the attic,  or I guess crawl space,|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|but, uh, oh, no,|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc

B|Well that's something,|ba
B|my husband's in construction|sd
B|and he won't even touch electrical stuff.|sd
B|He,|%
B|I mean, he'll do a little things|sd
B|but he won't do any major rewiring.|sd
B|He says he'd rather pay the electrician to handle it.|sd
A|Right,|b
A|he'll end up killing himself.|sv
B|Pardon.|br
A|End up killing theirselves.|sv
B|That's right.|ba
A|My husband, he'll change out a light switch,|sd
A|but that's about as far as he'll go.|sd
B|Well that's the way mine is, you know,|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|I mean, he, he well he said he went up in the attic and looked around|sd
B|and he was like, oh my God,|sd
B|he says, looks like a bunch of spaghetti up there.|sd
B|And we had squirrels in our attic when we first moved in because the roof was so sorry,|sd
A|Uh, was a what,|%
B|The roof was really sorry.|sd
B|I mean when we moved in,  we had no idea how bad it was.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|It was a wood shingle roof,|sd
B|and we,|%
B|the first year we were living there, we had to replace the roof.|sd
A|Well he put,|sd
A|which|%
A|I heard it's a law that you're only allowed to have three layers of shingles.|sd
A|Is it three or five,|sd
A|your husband probably knows.|sv
B|He probably knows,|aa
B|I don't know what it is off hand.|sd
A|Well, he's got seven layers of shingles up there,|sd
A|and he told us it was a completely new roof.|sd
A|Like I said, he didn't know what he was doing.|sd
B|Yeah,|aa
B|he must not of.|sv
B|We stripped ours, we stripped ours off.|sd
B|We didn't put it over, 'cause we put composition roof on.|sd
B|And we completely completely stripped all the old wood shingles off, put decking up, put the paper down, and I mean just started from scratch.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|Unfortunately when we were doing that it decided it wanted to snow and hail and rain.|sd
A|Oh, no.|ba
B|And we, and we had, we had almost, I'd say about half of the roof off,|sd
B|and it did this.|sd
A|And, uh, uh, a house full of snow.|^2
B|And a house full of snow, and rain,|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and it came down,|sd
B|it did this in the middle of the night.|sd
B|We have plastic, you know, just tied down on everything, you know, as best we could,  real thick edge stuff, I mean,|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and the wind came in from the north|sd
B|and it just blew everything off in the middle of the night|sd
B|and we were asleep|sd
B|and, and I woke up|sd
B|and I got up|sd
B|and it was about four o'clock in the morning|sd

A|That,|%
A|yeah.|b
B|I had water coming in everything that was in the ceiling, everywhere.|sd
B|And I mean it filled up my light fixtures, because they're the old kind.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And I would go in,|sd
B|and I'd turn on a light in the room, you know|sd
B|and the light would come on|sd
B|and the whole thing would be full of water.|sd
B|And I mean the light would still come on.|sd
B|It didn't blow up or anything|sd
A|My neighbor, or a friend of mine when I lived in Louisiana, her,|sd
A|we all lived on base,|sd
A|my husband was in the Army.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|She woke up about three or four o'clock in the morning, water dripping from hers.|sd
A|The neighbor's uh, washing machine had uh, over done something,|sd
A|I don't know|h
A|but it was leaking, just pouring water in|sd
A|and it all went through to her roof|sd
A|and it was coming out of the lights, fixtures.|sd
B|Oh.|b
A|The fire alarm went off for some reason.|sd
A|It shorted it out, or something.|sd
B|Oh, yeah,|ba

A|Your house sounds like mine because mine's pier and beam too.|sd
B|Oh really.|b
A|Yeah.|ny
B|Yeah,|b
B|they came in|sd
