B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and course, these days, you can't count on that because|sv
B|Right.|b
A|uh, you know, I feel bad for the people that are involved in that, uh, G M deal there in in Arlington|sd
B|Right.|b

B|and I'm sitting there making a hundred dollars a week, you know|sd
B|and, And they had all these|%
A|Is that right?|bh
B|I, I really believe they have done this to themselves, in a way, because of the unions being so stocked.|sv
A|The union,|b^m
A|yeah.|aa
B|And right now, anybody's that's laid off from G M will have a full year's paycheck.|sd
B|I just read this in the paper the other day.|sd

B|Yes.|aa
B|Oh, yeah,|aa
B|that's already hurting.|sd
A|You know, that's the ones that that that's going to hurt because they depend on that, uh,|sv
