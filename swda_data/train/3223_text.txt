Well, I almost forgot the topic,
I was waiting so long for, uh, for it to find somebody. Um,
It's on your favorite T V shows and why.
Right,
well, so what is your favorite T V show?
Uh, MAJOR DAD.
Oh, you like that one?
I, I love it,
I think it promotes good family values,
and it's funny.
Uh-huh.
Uh, I've never really watched that one.
You know, it's funny how you can just get in a mode where you only watch certain shows
That's
yeah.
and, uh, you know, there's, so there's only a few that I, that I like to watch routinely.
What kind do you like to watch?
Probably my favorite is, um, oh,
well, I like shows like GROWING PAINS
and, uh, what's the other one now, they moved from Tuesday night to Wednesday night,
so I don't get to watch it very much.
WONDER YEARS?
WONDER YEARS,
yeah,
that's my favorite. Uh,
I like both of those real much also.
I, I think basically, they same thing, they promote family values.
Yeah.
WONDER YEARS,
I, I guess that is supposed to be put out at a time when I was growing up or whatever.
I guess I can really relate to it,
and, uh, it's just a real cute show
Uh, I, I guess I like the shows that really have a real sense of, uh, I don't know, honesty or sort of a purity value, I guess.
I do, too.
I, I don't like it, uh, lot of the shows that, that I've liked in the past, like, uh, oh, GOLDEN GIRLS
and, some of them tend to get so risque,
and when you have children uh, watching it, that sometimes really starts to bother me
Uh-huh.
Yeah,
Right,
right.
and, uh, that's one of the reasons,
I mean, if you want to go all time favorite show, probably one of them was LITTLE HOUSE ON THE PRAIRIE
Uh-huh,
yeah,
my wife really likes that show,
yeah,
which I just, I was, I always felt was wonderful
Uh-huh.
uh, and so many of them nowadays, like I said, I think are just, um
Yeah.
uh, they, they go after, well,
they,
like I said, the risque stuff, just I guess they think that's what people want to watch.
Yeah,
well, there was,
but there's a sense of I guess, purity in the show,
like one of my favorite shows used to be HAPPY DAYS
Yes.
but, uh, you know, Richie always used to be so, you know, just so honest and pure I guess,
Yeah.
and when he left the show, you know, that, it seemed to be missing that part of it
Uh-huh.
and I never did like it after that
Uh-huh.
so, I don't know,
I, I say, see the same thing in like WONDER YEARS and a lot of the shows that I like to watch.
There always seems to be that kind of value in there somewhere.
Yeah,
I, I agree.
Uh, do you like the sports programming?
Yeah,
uh-huh.
Um, I, I enjoy those also, almost as, as much to a certain extent.
I'm,
our whole house is baseball fans
Uh-huh.
and, uh, we enjoy that,
and, uh
So you're going to watch a game tonight?
oh yeah,
oh, yeah
So do you, do you have a favorite for the series or anything?
Uh, probably the Pirates,
but only because of Steve Bushel, I guess
Oh, uh-huh.
otherwise I really don't care that much,
but, uh, you know, I'm, I'm annoyed that the Rangers got rid of him,
and, uh, I'd like to see him do well, like all the way to the bank I guess
Yes.
Yeah,
he's a nice guy.
I take it you live in the Dallas area.
Do you live in the Dallas area?
Live in, live in Plano.
Uh-huh,
yeah,
I live in Garland,
and, yeah,
I, I like Steve Bushel,
but I don't really like the Pirates.
I'm a big Saint Louis Cardinals fan
Uh-huh.
so, uh, I'm kind of, I'm kind of pulling for the Braves over all,
they, you know, they they've come from so far down,
Uh-huh.
I really would like to see them do well.
Well, yeah,
yeah,
it's, uh,
so I keep hoping the Rangers are going to do
Yeah,
one, one year they,
maybe they'll make it, I don't know
Right.
so, but, uh, yeah,
I like sports programming quite a bit,
but, uh, I guess my, my favorite shows are the,
and, you know, that getting back to the point that you made, that's really true,
we were watching ROSEANNE, I guess, couple of weeks ago,
and her daughter was talking about birth control, you know
Uh-huh.
and my daughter was kind of walking in during that time,
and, you know, she's only seven years old,
so,
Well, it's,
so many of them now, um, you know, it just seems like they feel like they have to stick that stuff in,
and and, uh, you know, I'm, you know, I'm, I'm an adult
Yeah.
Yeah.
and I have adult tastes now,
but I don't need that
Yeah,
yeah.
uh, I, I like things that, uh, are, are wholesome, I guess.
Yeah,
well that, that seems to be more our values, too,
like the WONDER YEARS, I, I mean, it's kind of risque stuff for, maybe for teenagers,
you know, or, and you can kind of relate to it you know,
Uh-huh.
I don't know,
that's,
I enjoy that a lot
Yes,
yes.
but, uh, you know, I agree with you,
the,
and it's funny because the shows,
like a lot of them that used to be considered risque, like THREE'S COMPANY and stuff, I think they, they maintained,
people would watch them because
there was that, uh, you know, there was really the period that was going on there,
I mean, he really wasn't messing around with the girls,
but everybody perceived him that way, and stuff
Uh-huh.
but as soon as, you know, he went to move in with another girl, the show just died
Yeah.
and it's, it's interesting that a lot of the shows are that way,
