The question was on lawn and garden work.
Um, how do you like it?
Well, I don't do much of it here.
I'm from, uh, from, uh, Colorado originally
and there are no bugs there.
And I didn't mind getting in the dirt there,
but, boy, I'll tell you what,
once I see these bugs around here, I'm just kind of out of it.
Oh, what kind do you have?
Oh, roaches and,
Do they really?
Oh, yes.
Cockroaches are awful here.
Oh.
Just awful.
So I,
Oh, and I know somebody that lives there,
and they never mentioned that problem
Oh, you're kidding, you're kidding.
No,
it's a
well, maybe they didn't mention it because it's just kind of a fact of life around here.
And, uh,
Oh, my.
They probably just take it for granted then.
It must be.
If they lived here, a lot of people I know just say, oh, I just stomp on them.
It doesn't matter.
They make good fertilizer in the garden.
Oh, yuck
Me, personally can't,
I don't have that problem, uh,
it's,
mine is mainly
we kind of have an understanding that, uh, I, I said I'll do inside work you do outside work.
Uh-huh.
And so I get into the gardening part of it, the fun part, like putting in the annuals and things like that.
Uh-huh
But I don't like, I don't like it dirty
No
I have to, you know I have to say that's not exactly my favorite thing either really
No,
I don't know.
We got the, we got the question
and I thought, oh, this is going to be interesting.
Two bits I'll get a man to talk to me, because they get stuck doing it all.
But although I do know a lot of my friends do like all the gardening work.
And this year we put in a new lawn in a new home
so, um, we've been fighting a drought here this summer and getting into fall.
Huh.
Today we just had a lot of rain
Oh, really?
Yeah,
so it's kind of nice.
I don't know how yours has been.
Well, it's been real hot here lately.
I mean we've had to actually have the air-conditioning on and everything
but, uh,
it's supposed to rain again now, uh, this weekend.
Oh, I see.
So, then,
Okay.
Well, we're leaving tomorrow
and we're going down to New Orleans
and from Ohio since we're right near Lake Erie
this is going to be a switch for us for a week going down there,
Yeah.
and I think we'll probably experience some of your weather although I think they have more humidity.
But, um, as far as the gardening and things like that goes I don't know, uh, too much, too much about, uh, how much I really do enjoy it myself.
Yeah.
Do you like it at all?
I, well, not here.
I mean it's just, here
I just can't stand to even get out in the, uh, in the dirt
Just,
Well, how about when you were in Colorado?
Well, I liked it a little bit
but I didn't, uh,
I was working at that time full-time and didn't have a lot of time, for that
Uh-huh.
and so that I think really, um, hampered it a little bit.
Well, and then, too, now like where we had the dry summer and we had to sprinkle constantly. My water bill was high.
And, uh, if you have that on a regular basis in Texas, I think I would go with something very dry to keep it off, you know.
Yeah.
But, uh, and with children, um, you probably don't have time anyhow to, to get into it.
No.
Not really
It's so, uh, okay, very good.
Uh-huh.
I guess we've kind of covered our subject matter, since neither one is really into gardening, are we?
Sounds like
No,
no.
Afraid not.
Uh, hopefully they'll give a subject I like one of these times Something I really know a lot about.
Right.
Okay.
Right.
nice talking to you.
Nice talking with you.
Okay,
bye-bye.
Uh-huh,
bye.
