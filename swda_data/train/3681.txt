A|I, I play that about six times a year|sd
A|and every year I hang my bag up if I get that five or six|sd

A|but I always go back to it|sd
B|Oh, I, uh, oh, I take spells,|sd
B|I'm, I'm kind of a compulsive obsessive person|sd
B|and when I start something, I, I go into it a thousand percent|sd

B|But, uh, I do some counted cross-stitch and some painting on shirts.|sd
A|Well, you do lots of stuff.|sv
B|Well, it doesn't seem like I get anything done,|sd
B|but I guess I do|sd

A|so that isn't too bad.|sd
B|How big is your band?|qw
A|Well, we got, uh, pretty good size band.|sd
