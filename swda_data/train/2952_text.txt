Okay,
what kind of things do you like to do in your spare time?
Well, uh, I have two children,
Uh-huh.
so I do not have a whole lot of spare time right now.
One of the things that I have made time for is, uh, playing softball.
Uh-huh.
I really enjoy,
I enjoy softball,
but I enjoy all kind of sports.
I enjoy watching and participating.
I really like water sports like swimming and skiing,
but I do not get to do that too often.
Yeah.
And then I, I really enjoy sewing,
but I do not get much of a chance to just really sit down and do much sewing.
How about you?
Oh, I, uh, like sports type things too.
We like to get out and walk,
and we like the water sports too.
Uh-huh.
But like you, unless you have a pool in your backyard, it is kind of hard to get to do that very often.
I, know it.
It is.
Do you work full time?
Yeah.
Well, part time.
We are going to have a baby in July.
Part time.
Oh.
So part of my big hobby has been trying to put together a nursery and all that kind of stuff, lately.
Right.
Yeah,
that definitely takes over your time.
Yeah,
it does.
I have been,
Is this going to be your first?
Yes.
Uh-huh.
Oh.
I have been doing some cross-stitch for something I wanted to put in the nursery.
So, I have not done that in years,
Uh-huh.
but I have kind of enjoyed that.
Yeah.
It is just hard to find the time to sit there and do it.
Right.
Well, that is,
it sure is fun to do that kind of thing because then you have got something to show for it.
Right,
yeah.
Yeah.
That is neat.
And I guess I kind of consider shopping a hobby
Yeah.
I do too.
I just go out just to, just to enjoy it and not really spend money sometimes, just look.
Yeah.
Yeah.
But you will probably find after your children get bigger, uh, like when they want things like tricycles, toys, things that cost quite a lot in the store, you can find that kind of stuff at garage sales for just a few dollars.
Yeah,
yeah,
we bought some baby clothes, yeah, last weekend at a garage sale.
And,
Yeah.
Yeah.
So, I am,
I have become a garage sale shopper.
And it is fun.
Uh-huh.
On the weekends I drive around, look to see, you know, who is selling what.
And I found my little daughter some tap shoes for her tap class. And just, you know, all kinds of things like that, that you would probably pay thirty dollars for,
Oh
and I got them for two dollars
Wow!
Yeah.
Yeah.
So,
Yeah, at a lot of places.
Yeah.
Yeah,
it is.
It, it does take more time.
But I do not work,
so, uh, that is something I have decided I am going to make sure my kids have a, have a happy growing up years
and
Right,
yeah.
I think that is important too.
I am not going to work after the baby comes.
Yeah.
Well, Well, that is good.
So, I guess, hopefully I will have more time for hobbies.
I am glad,
I do not know
Well, at first, when you first have a baby, you, uh, seems to take every moment of your time. Partly because you are not used to, you know, juggling your time around like that.
But, eventually the, you will, you will be doing lots of stuff.
Right.
So,
Yeah.
But I think, my husband is real into sports too.
He plays on a T I softball team and the church softball team.
And by the time he plays two games a week and I play a game a week, we go to lots of softball
Wow!
Yeah
But the kids enjoy going because there's usually a lot of other kids for them to play with
and we, that is getting outside and, you know, doing things they like to do too.
So,
Yeah.
So that is good.
A whole
your whole family can enjoy those hobbies.
Yeah.
And one other thing we are doing this year is, uh, we bought Wet and Wild passes.
Oh.
We have never done that before,
but the kids are always wanting to play in the water.
And, uh, like you said, unless you have a pool in your backyard or access to a good place to play, it is kind of hard.
And, uh, they have real good kiddie areas, uh, at both of the Wet and Wild's around here.
So, we are planning on going two or three times a week
Oh, wow.
That will make the summer go by in a hurry.
Yeah.
I think it will.
Keep the kids busy.
Yeah.
Because my oldest daughter is in school,
and she gets bored real fast when she is home with nothing to do.
Right.
So, I think that will be a lot of fun.
Yeah.
So we are looking forward to that.
Yeah.
Uh, do you consider yard work a hobby at all
or is that just a chore?
Well, when I got married, I thought it was going to be fun
Uh-huh
But my husband and I both, I think, consider it a chore.
It's,
Yeah.
our yard has had so many problems.
It has completely died out two times.
Oh, no.
And, uh, we have had to start all over trying to plant grass.
So it has become a chore
Huh.
Do you and your husband like to work in the yard?
Oh, well, we like it once in a while but not as often as we have to do it
Yeah.
I like to put flowers out and, you know, a few little things like that.
Uh-huh.
But as far as mowing every week, and finding time to get all that stuff done, it gets to be a chore.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
That is true.
Seems like sometimes hobbies do that.
They kind of take over and turn into work instead of fun.
Yeah.
Well, that is how sewing.
I love to sew,
and, uh, I wish I had more time to do it.
But sometimes I will get started on a project and then finishing it is more of a chore than
Yeah.
If it does not go quite, quite right.
Yeah.
Another thing I enjoy doing is cooking.
I, I like especially,
it is real strange,
but I like to cook for other people.
Like I have a friend that is, uh, pregnant
but she can't get up and walk around right now.
Oh, no.
So, I enjoy, you know, cooking things to take over to her house
or,
Oh, that is nice.
Yeah.
And it, it is fun for me to do that.
It is, it is something I enjoy doing.
It is funny though, it is like I do not really want to cook for us
It is kind of like when you are a kid and, and someone else's house was fun to clean,
but you did not want to do your own
Yeah.
Your,
How funny.
I think I will enjoy cooking more when I am not working, when I do not get home until five-thirty or six, and I have to cook and clean up,
Yeah.
Oh, yeah.
it is not, it is not fun.
But I think I will like it better.
Yeah.
When you are home it's, it makes a difference.
Yeah.
It sure does.
Uh-huh.
Well, do you guys go camping or anything like that?
Uh, yeah,
we have done a little bit of camping.
We like that.
It's,
there again, it is just so hard to find time to get away for a whole weekend.
Uh-huh.
Yeah.
Well, that is something that we are planning to do not this weekend, but the next.
My parents go camping a lot,
and they invited the kids and my husband and me to go with them
and,
Oh.
That sounds fun.
Yeah.
We are really looking forward to it.
The girls love it.
They have been a couple of times, and, uh, just getting to be outside, you know, all the time and sleep in a tent. And that is really fun to them.
So, We are looking forward to that.
Yeah.
Well, that sounds nice.
I, I think that would be a good family thing to start doing more often.
Yeah.
I think so.
Yeah.
My, uh, my husband loves to fish.
I am not much into fishing,
but, uh, my daughter thinks she wants to learn how to fish
so I think it will be real good for them
Uh-huh.
They can go fishing.
Yeah,
we have camped with some friends who have young children
and, uh, if you can find some place where those little sunfish are right around the shore where they can just pull in a line.
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
Oh, they have so much fun doing that.
Yeah.
And they think they are really great fishermen because they are catching so many
Yeah,
yeah.
Oh, I know.
Yeah,
uh, she is really looking forward.
I am hoping,
that is another thing though, when sometimes your, uh, hobbies can interfere with each other.
Because my husband is afraid he is going to have a softball tournament that weekend.
Oh.
And I am saying, no, no
Yeah.
Skip this tournament
Yeah.
If you are doing a lot of things, sometimes you have conflicts,
and you have to decide what you enjoy the most.
Right.
So,
Yeah.
Do you do any other crafts or anything besides your sewing?
Well, not really right now.
I keep thinking when the kids get bigger and I have a little more time, uh, I might take up, there is, I would love to cross-stitch.
I think cross-stitching is so pretty,
but I have never done any.
It is not too hard.
It is,
Yeah.
I do not think it is as hard as like knitting or crochet or something like that.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I, I crocheted when I was younger.
It is funny, when I was in high school, I made a blanket.
And,
but you know, I can't even remember how I did it now
Yeah
It has been so long since I did it that
but,
Yeah.
I started to to knit a sweater.
Uh-huh.
And I got off on my rows somehow,
and so what should have been the back all of a sudden was on the front.
Oh, yeah.
And then I tore it out and threw it down.
And I never have, picked it back up again,
and now I can't remember anything about it
Yeah,
well, I did the same thing.
Uh, when I was pregnant with my first daughter, I was really bored,
and I bought one of those latch hook rug kits.
Oh, uh-huh.
It was a real pretty rug.
And I thought, well I could use this as a gift or something, you know.
And oh, it was so,
it was beautiful,
but I did not realize how long it took.
And I got about two, two-thirds of it done,
and then I just,
I had the baby
Yeah
And then it was just like I forgot all about it.
Forget it.
And every once in a while I will be digging through the closet,
and I will find that thing.
And I will think, oh, maybe I ought to get the rest of that out, you know, and finish it.
Yeah.
But, uh, for a while there latch hook rugs were a real big, uh, hobby.
Yeah.
I remember that.
It seemed like people did them a lot.
Yeah.
Uh, uh, people do not do that much any more.
So, it was something easy I could do
Yeah,
yeah.
They are pretty easy.
Yeah.
Well, it has been real good talking to you.
Yeah.
You too.
And I hope you enjoy your camping trip.
Oh, thank you.
And thanks for calling.
Uh-huh. *used to mean "you're welcome"
Bye.
Bye-bye.
