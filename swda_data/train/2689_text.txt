Okay.
Okay.
What can we do about crime?
I don't know.
The one thing that keeps coming to mind to me is that they're, they don't have enough space in the prisons to put people
and they keep letting out people that have, you know, these horrible records.
Uh-huh.
So maybe we need to have more prisons or use the old army bases and make them into prisons or something.
That's one thing I guess I could think of
Uh-huh.
Uh, it's definitely a big concern,
I mean every day it's, you know, all
we live in a little small town,
and there's just rapes and murders and burglaries and everything all the time.
And you just can't get away from it no matter where you live.
Yeah.
Well I,
So it's pretty scary.
I'm, I'm from Butler,
and I can't say that there's too much of that there.
Uh-huh.
Um, I know the bigger cities have problems with it.
Yeah.
Uh, I really don't know what we can do about it.
Yeah.
Unless they start enforcing the, uh,
It's rough, because
like: t, t, t, t, uh, start giving more people death sentences.
That's the only thing I can think of.
Yeah.
Yeah,
well even some of the sentences just seem ridiculous.
I mean you hear about people, you know, six and seven times have committed burglaries
and they're still, you know, only serving six months in prison.
So that's definitely something.
They could have a more automatic sentence instead of having the judge having the choice of like, you know, from one month to ten years or something
Uh-huh.
That would be one thing that, you know, I think could help is having the laws be changed so that they were more stiff penalties and more automatic penalties, you know, for certain crimes
Yeah.
Yeah.
I, I, uh, I don't know what they're going to do with the problem because it just keeps getting worse and worse.
Yeah.
And one things that they're saying, now,
are you going,
are you a student
or are you in the work force
or,
Um, I'm a senior at Clarion University.
Oh, okay.
Because one of the things that I've heard so much about um, lately is the situations on campus where crime has gone up so much.
And apparently many of the, especially like in date rape, many of the, uh, you know, perpetrators seem to be getting off because the universities kind of cover up.
Well, not only that, a lot of them's not even turned in.
And they don't really,
You know, what I mean?
Wow.
A lot of times the girls don't even report it.
Yeah.
Yeah,
yeah.
Um, I've heard of a few case up here,
but I can't say that I've heard of, uh, you know, any significant amount.
Yeah.
Uh, but then again like you don't know how many girls are reporting them or not.
Yeah.
They say like only one in ten are reported.
I believe it.
Uh-huh.
That's awful.
So one thing they could do is probably support people more reporting it.
I know some police agencies try to have women police officers that the women can report to and this kind of thing.
But I'm sure it's still terribly traumatizing, you know, for people to report it.
Uh-huh.
So that's probably something else they could do.
Yeah.
I don't know,
it seems like something else in terms of crime is certainly involved with drugs, you know.
And that's like as long as,
it almost makes me feel, in a way, like making drugs legalized just to get all the money out of it and not have, you know,
because these kids are saying why should I go to high school
and so I can go out and work at Burger King, you know, for four dollars an hour or whatever, when I can make four hundred dollars a day selling drugs.
So that's certainly a big problem.
I don't know what the solution to that is.
Having more drug treatment centers available.
Jeez, I don't know.
Uh. See, you see now I would say that that's a bigger problem up here than even the date rape or anything.
Yeah.
I know a lot of people that partake in that.
And I'm not saying they're bad people,
but I, I, I would say that's a bigger problem.
Yeah.
Because it ends up,
even if it's just kind of like this social drug use, you're still ending up supporting these big drug pin, you know,
huge amounts, thousand and millions and millions of dollars are getting spent, you know, on higher and higher up, on drugs,
Uh-huh.
and it's definitely got to do with crime.
You know, you hear about people selling their babies, you know, to get some crack.
I mean, just, oh,
gosh, horrible stuff like that.
One of the things they're doing is, is they're prosecuting the women who are having these kids that are addicted to crack.
Uh-huh.
They said, uh, some of the statistics show like one out of every ten babies being born in these public hospitals are addicted to crack,
and their moms are crack users.
So that's, you know, another way of looking at it is as the woman is being a criminal, you know, for doing that to her child.
Uh-huh.
So I don't know who's the victim there.
I mean the kids are the victim, it seems like a lot of times the women are victims because they're addicted.
And, it's a very complicated problem.
I don't envy the government trying to cope with it. Gosh.
No, I don't either.
Yeah.
Well, I guess that's about all I have to say.
Uh,
Is there anything else you would want to,
No.
Okay.
I can't say that I, I just know that it's really bad in some areas
and something's going to have to be done sooner
but,
Yeah.
I don't, I don't know what they can do.
Yeah,
yeah.
It's frustrating.
Uh-huh.
Well,
Okay.
Well,  thanks for talking.
It was nice talking to you.
Have a good day.
You too.
Bye.
Bye, bye.
