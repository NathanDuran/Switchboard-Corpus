B|Well, um, I have a, a, a former exercise program.|sd
B|I'm a graduate student,|sd
B|and this semester, I'll tell you what, I, it's been almost impossible for me to get, you know, back to regular exercise.|sd
B|Um, last summer I was a, a swim instructor all summer and, and life guard,|sd
B|so it was really easy for me to get quite a bit of exercise swimming|sd
B|and, um, and since I worked at a recreation center I could, uh, you know, use those facilities quite often.|sd
B|But, um.|b
B|Oh, yeah.|b
B|Oh, yeah.|b
A|and and it's least hard on your body,|sd
B|Uh-huh,|b
B|and there's and there's no jarring on the.|sd
A|I,|%
B|Pardon?|br
A|It's the least hard on your body as far as, uh, impact|sd
B|Exactly, yeah,|aa
B|um,|%
A|and|%
B|yeah,|b
B|fluid resistance.|bf
A|Right,|aa
A|right.|aa
B|Uh-huh,|b
B|uh-huh.|b
B|How about you?|qo
A|Well, I do, uh, little aerobics, oh, three or four times a week,|sd
A|but it's not enough to,|%
A|boy if I go, in the summer time I try to jog, jog a couple of miles|sd
B|Oh, yeah.|b
A|and, uh, well, you know, even doing that three or four times a week, when summer hits, that's a hard thing to go out and and go jogging for, uh half hour or so,|sd
B|Yeah.|b
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|but so, I'm not quite getting the level that I need to.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Yeah.|b
B|Do you, do you kind of think it's a chore,|qy
B|or do you enjoy it?|qrr
A|I like it.|na
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|I like it, uh,|sd
A|part of my problem is I have small children,|sd
A|so, uh, to do a whole lot just requires a lot of, oh, coordination as far as scheduling and that type of, uh, deal, you know, uh,|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Sure,|b
B|yeah.|%
A|Of course, you got a little different direction going,|sv
A|but, uh.|%
B|Uh-huh,|b
B|yeah.|%
B|Uh, I, um, I used to, uh, I used to weigh, uh, two hundred fifteen pounds,|sd
B|and now I weigh only about one, about one seventy-five. Um,|sd
B|so I drastically had to change the way I ate when I, when I first moved to college,|sd
B|and, uh, I had started weight lifting quite regularly,|sd
B|and so I got my weight down,|sd
B|and it's kind of easy for me to forget about it now, because, uh, you know, when I'm not fat like I used to be  I don't worry about it|sd
A|Right,|b
A|you don't notice it  as much,|^2
B|, yeah.|%
A|yeah.|%
B|Uh-huh.|aa
B|Although lately I have noticed, you know, even if I gain, like two pounds, I start, I start feeling it|sd
B|and,|%
A|You feel it, don't you?|qy
B|Uh-huh.|ny
A|It's amazing how, uh, how much, uh, it changes,|sd
A|and I weigh probably about the same I weighed for, oh, I don't know how many years,|sd
A|but, uh, it's changed places|sd
A|And things don't fit just quite exactly fit the same.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|But, uh, so, do you do, uh,|qy
A|in Texas, uh, does|%
A|there, probably quite a few facilities.|qy^d
B|Yeah,|ny
B|there are.|sd
B|Um, I'm living in a dorm right now,|sd
B|and so right downstairs there's a facility.|sd
B|And I really feel kind of guilty for not working out more than I do because there's a facility right downstairs where all, you know, all we have to do is, is, uh, run down there|sd
A|Do you enjoy it,|qy
A|or is it, uh.|qrr
A|If you can have, find the time it's just the.|^2
B|Uh-huh|b
B|yeah,|aa
B|I really do, because I like to get, you know, get off alone and just do that for a while,|sd
B|but that's hard, you know.|sd
A|Yeah,|b
A|it is hard|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|it is hard.|sd
A|It's, uh, like anything else whether or not you want to sacrifice another half hour.|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|My problem is I don't want to wake up another half hour earlier and do more|sd
B|Exactly.|aa
A|Don't get enough sleep as it is,|sd
A|right|^g
B|Uh-huh,|ny
B|yeah,|ny
B|yeah.|ny
A|and, uh, kind of have,|%
A|if you're having the pressures of school and, uh, everything else, it's kind of,|sv
A|course it's really, you know,|sv
A|as soon as you do it, it's really a release.|sv
B|Oh, yeah.|b
A|You feel invigorated|sv
A|and you feel oh, you feel in a lot better shape just like eating right foods.|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Yeah,|b
B|ready to go another twelve hours.|^2
B|Yeah,|b
B|yeah.|b
A|If I eat very much sugar, boy, just does something.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Do you have to watch what you eat pretty regularly?|qy
A|I do.|na
A|I have to be real careful.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|I stopped eating meat about, oh, uh, must have been eight months ago.|sd
A|Did you?|^g
B|Uh-huh,|ny
B|completely.|sd
B|I mean, any kind of meat|sd
B|or, and I, and I really feel a lot better now.|sd
A|Makes a lot of difference.|qy^d
B|Yeah,|ny
B|it really does.|sd
A|Well, there's a lot of fat in meat.|sd
B|Uh-huh,|b
B|yeah,|%
B|that's it, I mean, that's about where almost all of the fat comes from|sd
A|Right.|b
B|and so. I found that really helps.|sd
A|And unless you really like, uh, fish.|sd
A|Fish is pretty good for you,|sd
A|but, uh.|%
B|Yeah,|b
B|I eat that,|sd
B|I think I've eaten fish like twice since.|sd
B|I used to eat a lot of fish, too,|sd
B|but I just tried to cut it all out for a while and see what happens.|sd
A|Kind of see what happens.|^2
B|Yeah,|aa
B|and I like it.|sd
A|I've tried to do that with sugar|sd
B|I don't know if I'm that brave yet .|sd

A|Well, you, too.|fc
A|Good luck, uh,|fc
A|enjoy college while you can.|fc
A|Let me tell you it's, uh.|fc
B|Well, I'm in graduate school now.|fc
B|I, I, I kind of feel like I wish I could have gone back to undergraduate now|fc
A|It's a little different, uh challenge, isn't it?|fc
B|Yeah.|fc
B|Yeah,|fc
