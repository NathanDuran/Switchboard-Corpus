A|Okay,|b
A|so do you do a lot of cooking in your family?|qy
B|Um, I do some every now and then,|ng
B|I, I work|sd
B|and my wife's home during the day|sd
B|so she usually ends up doing most of it.|sd
A|Oh, yeah.|b
B|When I was single we used to always cook, around the house.|sd
A|Yeah,|b
A|do, do you like to cook.|qy
B|Huh, yeah,|ny
B|I really like it,|sd
A|Yeah,|b
A|yeah.|b
B|um, there's a few dishes,|%
B|like, I, I grew up with the, um, you know, having Polish and Ukrainian food.|sd
A|Oh, really.|b
B|And my wife, she likes Italian and stuff,|sd
A|Oh.|b
B|so we, we definitely have different tastes,|sd
B|so.|%
A|Yeah,|b
A|yeah,|b
A|but that's neat though, because you get to have different stuff|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|Yeah,|b
A|I'm not, I'm a pretty bad cook|sd
A|I'm pretty bad.|sd
A|My husband is really good,|sd
A|he put himself through college working in restaurants.|sd
B|Oh, wow.|ba
A|And, uh, he's much better cook than I am,|sd
A|so, when I was home I still cooked a lot|sd
A|and I was in to a lot of vegetarian stuff.|sd
A|And now, I went back to work about a year and a half ago|sd
A|so, one of the things that he took over was the cooking|sd
A|and the kids are thrilled,|sd
A|they're really happy, that I don't cook anymore.|sd
B|Uh, they're like, uh, preferring it now, right|qy
A|Yeah,|ny
A|they say oh dad, let dad cook mom,|sd
A|let him do it|^q
A|But, um, so, so do you all, do you have kids?|qy
A|You obviously have one.|qy^d
B|Yeah,|ny
B|two,|sd
B|uh-huh.|ny
A|Okay,|bk
A|you have two.|bf
B|Yeah,|aa
B|one is, uh, nine months|sd
B|and the other is two and a half.|sd
A|Two and half, oh.|b^m
B|Yeah,|b
B|that's the hard part is cooking with, uh, kids around because, uh,|%
A|I was just going to say, makes a difference in what you eat doesn't it|qy
A|Or are you not at that stage yet?|qrr
B|Yeah,|ny
B|it does|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|We try our hardest to get them to eat what we, eat, you know.|sd
A|Right.|b
B|And my sister, uh, she's the master of the fast order grill, you know,|sd
A|Oh, yeah.|b
B|she can make, uh, she makes six different meals,|sd
B|but.|%
A|Oh my gosh.|ba
B|Like to have one thing, you know,|sd
B|one likes chicken nuggets, the other one like hot dogs,|sd
A|Oh my gosh,|ba
A|I couldn't|sd
B|and then she makes noodles with, uh, with,  soy sauce or whatever,|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|so, all things.|%
A|Boy, I couldn't do that,|sd
A|I|%
B|But, um, yeah,|b
B|our favorite,|%
B|let me think,|^h
B|I was thinking of the one recipe that, uh, that we made.|sd
B|I guess the thing that always turned out the best for us was something we thought looked really fancy but was real easy,|sd
B|and that was, um,  uh, scallops, uh, scallop, um,|sd
A|What's that.|qw
A|Oh really.|b
B|it has a French name,|sd
B|it basically means that it has a Swiss cheese, cream sauce with it|sd
B|and you pour it over rice,|sd
A|Oh yeah,|b
A|what's, what is that, Saint Jack or something.|qy
B|Yeah, uh.|ny
A|Scallops Saint something,|sd
A|or, yeah, .|%
B|Yeah,|b
B|I can't even remember what the recipe's name is anymore,|sd
A|Yeah,|b
A|yeah.|b
B|but, uh, it was basically just ground up Swiss cheese and then, uh, standard cream sauce base and then, uh the scallops.|sd
A|Really,|b
A|with scallops.|^2
B|An, and it sounds sort of funny|sv
B|but it tastes really good.|sd
A|No,|ar
A|no,|ar
A|I'm from New England,|sd
A|so we, we had, um, a lot of seafood before we moved down here.|sd
A|And, uh, that sounds delicious to me.|sv
B|Yeah.|b
A|That sounds great.|ba
B|Yeah,|b
B|but, uh,|%
A|I think, we're just thinking of having, a, uh, dinner party.|sd
A|We went to this dinner party the other night that was kind of like a game,|sd
A|they had, uh, a murder mystery,|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and you came dressed as one of the characters|sd
A|and you had to solve the mystery during the dinner,|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and it was really fun|sd
A|and so we, we were thinking we wanted to do, you know, we were going to try doing it ourselves,|sd
A|but we're trying to decide what can we serve because at this one the hostess was pretty busy running around trying to get stuff ready for the table|sd
A|and that kind of interrupted the game,|sd
A|so,  so I was thinking there's this Beef Bourguignonne recipe that I've tried before that's pretty good|sd
B|Right,|b
B|yeah.|b
A|and then you can make that ahead|sd
A|and you can just leave it in the pot on a stove until you're ready.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|So that's, uh,|%
B|Yeah|b
B|that's another thing|sd
B|I have a problem with my wife,|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|she, uh, she likes to, um, she doesn't like the beef dishes.|sd
B|She likes the chicken and fish,|sd
A|Uh, yeah.|b
B|and, like I said, we always ate beef and, uh, pork,  you know, a lot,|sd
A|Oh, yeah.|b
B|so|%
A|I know,|ba
A|my husband did too|sd
A|His parents are Austrian|sd
A|and they, uh, always made sure they had a lot of meat at the table|sd
B|Oh yeah,|b
B|red meat, plenty of good red meat.|sv
A|Yeah,|aa
A|yeah,|aa
A|yeah.|aa
B|My dad could eat, a, a meal with out any vegetables at all.|sd
A|Oh, my gosh.|ba
B|And, uh, Susan's, you know, they had, you know meatless meals, you know.|sd
A|Yeah,|b
A|yeah.|b
B|My dad wouldn't know what to do.|sd
A|Oh, gosh,|ba
A|so do you,|%
B|Course, she grew up Catholic|sd
B|so you know, they,  they sort of come with the,|%
A|Oh, they did the,|%
B|there's a certain amount of meatless meals you have to have|sv
A|That you do,|aa
A|right,|aa
A|right,|aa
A|that's just part of it.|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|Yeah,|b
A|we didn't, my family didn't,|sd
A|but when I got into the vegetarian cooking we got kind of used to that,|sd
A|but my husband always did it kind of grudgingly,|sd
A|he never,|%
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|There was dishes that he really enjoyed, eating.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|there were several things that he liked|sd
A|but it never was really, something that he would have chosen.|sd
A|It's just that I cooked|sd
A|so he had to put up with it|sd
B|Right.|b
A|So, but there was one thing that he couldn't stand|sd
A|and that was soybeans.|sd
A|I tried it like once or twice|sd
A|and he just could not eat it,|sd
A|so I never,|%
A|I had,|%
A|I was limited.|sd
A|I had to make vegetarian meals without using soy beans,|sd
A|but.|%
B|Yeah,|b
B|it's hard to get a protein content up then|sv
A|Yeah,|aa
A|yeah.|aa
A|That's true|aa
B|Yeah,|b
B|I like, I like them every now and then for a change,|sd
B|it's nice.|sv
A|Yeah,|aa
A|some of the stuff is good,|sv
A|but it just, it was a tremendous amount of cooking|sd
A|Because you do have to make sure you have the right combinations of different proteins to make sure they're complete,|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and we had little kids at the time, you know,|sd
A|when I was home with them, and it, it was just so much cooking,|sd
A|I couldn't, I don't like to cook.|sd
A|And I'm not really that great at it|sd
A|so it just turned out to be too much of a, too much, too much cooking.|sd
A|So, well, I guess I'll let you get back to feeding your little one there.|ad
B|No, uh,|ar
B|he's all done.|sd
A|He's set,|qy^d
A|oh okay.|%
B|Yeah,|ny
B|yeah,|ny
B|I set him down.|sd
A|Okay.|bk
A|Do you like to bake at all,|qy
A|or do you, do you get into that's, that,|qrr
B|Yeah,|ny
B|we used to do that, um,|sd
B|my mom, used to go crazy, every Sunday, until my dad like blew up, you know|sd
A|Yeah|b
B|after he gained about eighty pounds after coming back from the Navy, she stopped doing it.|sd
B|But, um, she used to have, you know, two dozen sticky buns, three bread rolls, you know, every week.|sd
A|Really,|b
A|no kidding.|b
B|And, um, the sticky buns, of course, would last, you know three or four days|sd
B|and that would be it.|sd
A|Yeah,|b
A|then be gone.|b
A|I know,|ba
A|that's the thing about baking.|sv
A|I used to, I, I don't mind baking at all|sd
A|and I, I can do a pretty good pie,|sd
A|we have this pie crust recipe in our family that my grandmother gave my mother|sd
A|and my mother taught me how to make it.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And, um, so I can make a pretty mean pie,|sd
A|but, um, I don't do it anymore because it's just too fattening.|sv
A|We had the same kind of problem.|sd
A|If you make homemade bread,|sv
B|Uh-huh|b
A|I mean, it's supposed to save you money|sv
A|but you eat like three times the amount of bread that you usually eat|sv
A|It tastes so good.|sv
B|Uh-huh,|aa
B|we always, we had that bread that was, uh, um,|sd
B|you ever seen the, the starter bread,|qy
B|I can't remember what it's called,|sd
B|they call it the, um, Amish bread here|sd
B|but,|%
A|Oh, uh, yeah.|ny
B|uh, it's made with,|%
B|you just leave it out,|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|you know, and you let it spoil sort of.|sd
A|Yeah,|ny
A|uh-huh,|ny
A|I've heard of that, I've heard of it,|sd
A|but I've never done it.|sd
B|You know, yeah.|b
A|That sounds pretty good.|ba
B|Yeah,|aa
B|it tasted pretty good, really.|sd
A|Yeah,|b
A|oh yeah.|b
B|But, uh, it's the sort of thing where you let a portion of it go bad|sd
B|and then you add all these other ingredients to it,|sd
B|but.|%
A|Yeah,|b
A|and then you you make the bread|sd
A|but you pinch off a portion, or save a portion of it for the next time, or something.|sd
B|Yeah|b
B|right,|b
B|you take some of the batter out and give it to someone else|sd
B|and that's how they continue the thing.|sd
A|Yeah,|b
A|yeah,|b
A|yeah.|b
A|I know, it sounds, it always sounded,|%
A|I don't know how safe that was|qh
B|Yeah,|aa
B|I know it sounded strange to me too,|sd
B|I figure, well you're baking it|sv
B|so, you know, yeah.|%
A|Yeah|aa
A|that's true,|aa
A|that's, that's got to kill anything I guess,|sv
