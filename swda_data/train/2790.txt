A|All right.|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
B|What, what changes do you think have taken place in the last generation?|qw
A|I guess the biggest one is number of women in the work force.|sv
B|Yeah.|b
A|Few are, uh, basically staying home and being homemakers, and raising kids exclusively.|sv
B|Uh-huh.|aa
B|Yeah,|aa
B|I, I, I grew up in, uh, sixties and early seventies|sd
B|and, uh, my mom didn't work at all when I was growing up.|sd
B|She didn't start working until I was, um, well into high school.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|So, I, I had the advantage of having a mom at home that nowadays kids, it's a luxury item for mothers to be home with their kids.|sv
A|Yeah,|aa
A|true.|aa
A|Well, mine taught kindergarten|sd
A|but she was always, uh,|sd
A|I guess her schedule was shorter|sd
A|so she was always, uh,  home,|sd
B|Always home by the time you got home.|^2
A|yeah.|%
A|Yeah,|%
A|that, that statistic I guess has been growing every year|sv
A|it's like something around sixty, sixty-five percent or so now.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|Uh, I'm not sure what the future holds for that|sd
A|whether,|%
B|It seems like there's, it seems that there's a grass roots, um, effort or whatever going on|sv
B|I, I, um, clean houses part-time,|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and almost all the people that I clean for, believe it or not, are mothers that don't work|sd
A|Huh.|b
B|Um,|b
A|That's unusual|ba
B|they are, they're all, um,|%
B|it's, and it's, I think it's kind of a new movement|sv
B|it's going back towards, you know,|sv
B|women have come into the work force in the last twenty, thirty years|sd
B|and now they're wanting to go back to the old days where, you know, women stayed home with the kids, you know, and try to give the kids quality time.|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And I, I think that in the future you're, I think you're going to see a lot more, um, women choosing to not work after they have a baby.|sv
A|Yeah.|b
B|Um, I think with, uh, the, uh, the work force with the, the salaries that|sv
B|a lot of, a lot of the women that I work for have husbands who are, um, vice-presidents of companies|sd
B|and I think with, uh, um, this, it seems like it's more the upper-class people,|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|um, I don't see it as much, the, like in my situation where I don't, I don't have children yet,|sd
B|but ideally I would like to be able to stay home with my kids.|sd
B|But realistically that's, I'm, I'm realizing that's probably not going to be possible, um, for middle-class people to be able to live just on one income.|sv
A|Yeah,|aa
A|that is tough.|sv
A|Yeah,|aa
A|we're looking at that now,|sd
A|my wife's about six months along.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|I think it's going to be a luxury item to be able to stay home with your kids.|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|You know, it's going to kind of kind of go along with the B M W in the driveway and, or in the garage or whatever.|sv
A|True.|ba
B|Um, and the quarter of a million dollar home or whatever.|sv
A|Yeah.|aa
A|I'm surprised that the main people you work for are women that do stay home.|sd
A|I would think it would be women that were working full-time.|sv
B|Yeah,|aa
B|believe it or not though the, all the women that stay home are real busy when they are home.|sv
A|Huh.|b
B|Um, they're real active in volunteer work.|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|Um, one of the women is real active with, uh, Muscular Dystrophy. And, uh, does a lot of, of work with them on a volunteer basis|sd
B|but it's still, it's almost like a job,|sv
B|she just doesn't get paid for it.|sd
A|Huh. Well, I guess that's good that they, they've got something to keep them active.|sv
B|Yeah.|aa
B|When, when your wife has her baby, is she going to stay home|qy
B|or is she going to,  go back to work?|qrr
A|Yeah,|ny
A|we're,  we're going to try and have her stay home, for as long as possible.|sd
A|What do you think?|qo
B|That, that, that,|%
B|I would, I would like to be able to do that.|sd
A|Yeah,|b
A|we think it's, uh, that important|sv
A|and I, I kind of hope that the trend goes back in that direction.|sd
A|I'm a, a counselor and a therapist,|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and I work with adolescents,|sd
A|and I see some of the problems the kids have when they don't have a real good family structure.|sd
B|Yeah,|b
B|I, I see a difference in the generation of, even the generation before me,  uh, were, you know, mom was like, um, Mrs Cleaver, uh, you know, June Cleaver or whatever,|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|where the, the attitudes were a lot different.|sv
B|Um, as far as, I think the kids back then seemed to be a lot more,|sv
B|um, there wasn't a lot of the drugs and alcohol and,  um, a lot of the, the things that are going on in today's society,|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|I think morally, um, it seems like there was, people were a lot better back then as far as higher standards.|sv
A|True.|ba
A|Well, the husbands' roles are almost nonexistent in family anymore in terms of being the father figure|sv
A|and with women working so much they're kind of pulled out of it too.|sv
B|Yeah.|b
A|So, kids are raised around their friends and by the media.|sv
B|Yeah,|aa
B|that's true.|aa
A|And that's, you know, that's contributed,|sv
B|And I think, I think you're going to see a lot more of that in the future.|sv
A|Yeah,|aa
A|maybe that's contributed to a lot of the problems that we see all the time,|sv
A|so. If there was some way for, for women to, to stay home even if they could work, you know,|sv
A|there are a lot of jobs that are coming about, like in computers at home,  and those types of things, that would at least in some ways, um, bridge the gap|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Yeah,|aa
B|I, I think that, um, in the future, um, the, the family unit as it, as it once was known, is, is going to be nonexistent|sv
B|What, how do you, what do you think?|qo
A|About?|qw
B|That as far as|%
B|do you think there's going to be still a family unit|qy
B|or, or do you think that, um, the trend is going more towards single parenting?|qrr
A|The balance|%
A|I don't,|%
A|the, the divorce rate keeps hovering around fifty percent or so|sd
A|and it got higher than that for a while.|sd
A|Um, that's hard to say.|sv
A|Families are such a strange configuration anymore.|sv
A|Um, I, I see a lot of families where,|sd
A|you know, in the, in the back,|%
A|I grew up about the same time you did,|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and back in those times we pretty much were taught how to be responsible.|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|Uh, nowadays it's not the case,|sv
A|kids don't, kids are bombarded with all kinds of junk|sv
A|and one of the reasons, I guess, is because there's so much more income in the family with both parents working.|sv
A|They get bombarded with junk|sv
A|and they don't have to do anything around the house.|sv
A|They never learned to be responsible when,|sv
B|Yeah.|b
A|the bigger trend called the boomerang kids where they move out for a while|sv
A|and they come back,|sv
A|and you got twenty and thirty year olds who are living at home with mom and dad|sv
A|so,|%
B|Yeah.|b
A|you know, you create a bigger, bigger family, generation after generation but not really on purpose.|sv
B|Yeah.|b
A|So. It's not, not a real functional situation anyway.|sv
A|So, you know, I don't know it's, I don't know that that trend's going to change the single parent type families|sd
A|and the families, as long as we've got so many other crazy things going on in society.|sv
B|Yeah,|b
B|I, I think that eventually the, the family unit's just not going to even exist anymore.|sv
B|like you said the divorce rate is getting so high that I think there's going to be more single parent families than there are, um, you know, two parent families.|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|That's pretty sad.|ba
A|Yeah,|aa
A|it is,|aa
A|I guess unless, unless there's a, a major swing in the change of what's important to people, you know, probably keep going downhill.|sv
A|And I, I don't know|h
A|we, we feel like that, that we can make it on one income|sv
A|it, it may be tough|sv
A|but we may have to give up on some, some things.|sv
B|I, I think in the long run though your child will benefit from that.|sv
A|Yeah.|b
B|And it will, it will make the, the strain worthwhile.|sv
A|Yeah,|aa
A|I think so too.|aa
B|Well, I, I need to go ahead and, and wrap it up.|fc
A|Okay.|fc
B|Um, it was really nice talking to you.|fc
A|Well, I've enjoyed it, Stephanie.|fc
B|And, uh, thanks a lot.|fc
A|Uh-huh.|fc
B|Okay,|fc
B|bye-bye.|fc
A|Bye-bye.|fc
