A|Are you ready to start?|qy
B|Yes.|ny
A|Okay|bk
B|Have you recently bought a new car Catherine?|qy
A|Well, I just found out that my car like an old was thirty months old,|arp_nd
A|and it doesn't seem like it's that old.|sd
B|Oh.|bk
A|Seems like I just bought it.|sd
B|Oh, wow.|ba
A|It's an eighty-nine|sd
A|and I bought it, uh, in, uh, eighty-eight|sd
A|so, yeah.|%
B|Well, I really, the last car we got was a, was a used car.|sd
B|I really don't prefer buying a new car.|sd
B|I like to let somebody else pay for that|sd
A|I know,|aa
A|I really will do that the next time, I buy it too.|sd
B|But, uh mine was a year old,|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and we bought it for very functional purposes,|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and that was we bought a station wagon.|sd
B|We wanted an economical car to operate,|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|but we wanted one that could carry a lot of equipment.|sd
B|So, we chose a Nissan Stanza wagon.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And I've never been sorry,|sd
A|Oh, that's wonderful.|ba
B|however the need for that kind of car has changed now,|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Oh, okay.|b
B|and, uh, while it is still good, and it's quite serviceable, and I'll drive it until it no longer is reliable.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Huh.|b
B|And probably then some|sd
B|I'll spend a lot of time praying over it before I give it up.|sd
A|Sure.|b
B|I think that I would like to,|sd
B|if you know, we all say, if I could have the car I always wanted I would either buy a Nissan Maxima, uh,|sd
A|Right.|b
B|I'm sold on Nissans.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|I a or, or foreign cars actually.|sd
B|Uh,|%
A|But do you feel though, uh, craftsmanship is much superior to the American abilities?|qy
B|Uh,|^h
A|Is that how you,|qy
A|I have never,|%
B|its reliability.|qy
A|Its|%
B|Its reliability.|sd
B|And, uh, I, you know, I've read all the CONSUMER REPORTS and things,|sd
B|and they just run head and shoulders above the American made cars.|sd
B|If Ford was a head and the shoulders above it, I'd buy a Ford.|sd
A|Isn't that a shame.|bh
B|But I had, uh, had a Ford Escort that absolutely needed taps the day we got it.|sd
A|My word isn't that sorry.|bh
A|That's sorry.|ba
B|Uh, you know, I mean it was ready for the graveyard.|sd
A|My word.|ba
B|And I spent as much on that car in twelve months as I spent for the car.|sd
A|Oh, mercy.|ba
B|So,|%
A|You,|%
B|and that was just trying to hold us,|sd
B|getting out of that was a used car.|sd
A|Huh.|b
B|And it was an older car,|sd
A|Huh.|b
B|but, you know, Escort is supposed to have a great track record as far as sales.|sv
A|Huh.|b
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|But it's just, it just was not|sd
B|and you get stung a time or two,|sv
A|Sure.|aa
B|and you say, no thanks.|sv
A|No thanks.|b^m
A|That's right.|aa
B|So, I just trusted the CONSUMER REPORTS and the auto, uh, reports|sd
A|Uh-huh,|b
A|uh-huh.|b
B|had my son who knows a lot about that, study them thoroughly,|sd
B|and he gave me four choices of cars to buy|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|An Escort definitely was not among them.|sd
B|In fact, there wasn't an American car in there.|sd
A|Wow.|ba
B|Uh, the Nissan came|sd
B|and, and we bought the Nissan for functional purposes not what the CONSUMER REPORTS said we should get.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|But it served our needs.|sd
B|Uh, later on his reports, the reports that he studied showed that, uh, Nissan was head and shoulders above the rest in the in the class that we were looking for.|sd
B|And that, and I'd rather have a Maxima than a Cadillac.|sd
B|I really would.|sd
B|It's not necessarily prestige,|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|but it's comfort.|sv
B|Uh, there's a lot of features on there that are desirable if you're going to pay that kind of money for a car.|sv
B|Uh,|%
A|Who makes that car?|qw
B|Nissan.|sd
A|I mean but where are they, where are they,|qw
A|what, what is their location,|qw
A|is it, uh, Asian|qy
A|or is it European|qrr

B|uh-huh,|ny
A|Okay,|bk
B|uh-huh.|b
A|I didn't know.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
B|And, uh, if I couldn't have my luxury Maxima then I'd buy me a fancy little red C R X sports car|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Okay|b
B|I mean, you know, every every one of us have two sides|sv
A|Yeah,|aa
A|I guess so|aa
A|that's true.|aa
A|Yeah.|aa
B|Yeah.|b^m
B|Now what about you,|qo
B|if you could have the car that you wanted what would you get|qw
A|If, if, if I had the car I wanted.|^h
B|and why?|qw
A|Gee.|ba
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|Probably, um, uh, let's see, I like the looks of the Lincoln Town car|sd
B|Uh-huh,|b
B|uh-huh.|b
B|Yeah.|b
B|See there,|%
A|But I, I don't know the performance of it.|sd
A|That's a, Ford product,|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b

B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|I tell you that's sad too because there one time Ford was the best, that was made.|sv

A|Um, well, the comfort of a large car that the security of a large car. Um, and the luxuries of a large car.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|Uh, now color preferences,|sd
A|I think I would opt to go with a bronze. Which is probably closest to gold that you can get|sd
B|Uh-huh,|b
B|uh-huh.|b
B|Yeah.|b
B|Oh, wow.|ba
B|We like the stuff that glitters|bf
A|Yeah.|aa
B|Good.|ba
B|There's nothing wrong with that.|sv
B|Actually I think probably if I were going to get if I were going to be practical, which doesn't mean I would be,  I would prefer white. Because, simply because it's more visible at night.|sv
A|Right,|b
A|well, practical|%
A|yes|%
A|that's,|%

B|Now the interior,|sd
B|okay,|%
B|I don't care about the interior just as long as it's not black or red.|sd
A|Uh-huh,|b
A|uh-huh.|b
B|But if I had the little red C R X , I guess the interior would have to be black leather|sd
B|and I'd have to live with that.|sd
B|And if I got the C R X it would have to have a real good sound system in it because I'd want that too.|sd
A|Oh.|b
B|I'd just go back to my teenage years and just throw all my experience to the wind|sd
A|Um, can you, uh, hang on again|ad
B|Uh-huh.|aa
A|Thanks|ft
A|I've got the phones for lunch hour.|sd

A|Uh-huh,|b
