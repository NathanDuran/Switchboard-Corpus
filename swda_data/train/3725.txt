B|Uh-huh.|ny
A|Yeah.|b
A|Uh, you have got a pretty big family.|qy^d

A|Oh, yeah.|b
B|And you?|qy
A|Yeah,|ny
A|we have a pretty big family,|sd
A|but most of us,|%
A|well, uh, uh, I am originally from West Virginia.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|Most of the family is right in the West Virginia, uh, uh, what they call Tri-State area, uh, northern West Virginia, eastern Ohio, southwestern Pennsylvania.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|Most everybody is right in that area.|sd
B|That makes it a lot easier.|sv
B|A lot more convenient.|sv
B|That is why we only do it once every five or ten years.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|because it is always that hard to get everyone together.|sv
A|Yeah.|b
A|They put one together for our family about once every June.|sd
A|It was on my grandmother's birthday,|sd
A|but she is, she is gone now.|sd
B|Yeah,|b
B|see that is kind of what happened with ours.|sd
B|That is why we have not had one in a long time.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
A|Uh.|b

A|and some put up the volleyball net and sit around and tell stories and catch up and play volleyball all day and get really fat|sd
B|Eat a lot.|qy^d
A|Oh, gosh.|ba
B|It is a lot harder for us because we are like I said we are spread out|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|and so we have to plan anywhere from six, well really probably a year ahead of time so that everyone, can uh, start their, uh, vacation time.|sd
A|Schedule vacation time|b
A|and yeah.|b
A|We|%
A|uh, Sat, uh, Sunday afternoon or, uh, sometimes it has been like on a Saturday afternoon.|sd

A|uh, actually, we, we have only made one of them since we got married about four years ago. One of the family reunions.|arp_nd
B|Yeah.|b
A|But we are both in school|sd
A|so that makes it kind of tough.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|They usually, uh, they have been happening, uh, just after the summer semester starts.|sd
B|You can't really get away.|qy^d
A|Usually not.|ng
A|We managed to get to one.|sd
A|That was before I started school|sd
A|and she took that summer off.|sd
A|But, uh,|%
B|Well, now that we have been talking about it, I, uh, I am kind of getting home sick now.|sd

A|Oh goodness.|ba
B|Well, my, my grandfather is the only one that is still around.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|And see, my grandmother is the one that use to plan this stuff basically.|sd

B|So, unless the aunts and uncles really get on the ball and put stuff together, it is kind of like.|sd
B|She was like the glue,|sd
B|so.|%
A|Yeah,|b
A|I understand.|ba
A|Where is home for you?|qw

A|Yeah.|b
B|But, uh, you know, we have relatives scattered out all over Louisiana, Mississippi, uh, here in Texas|sd

A|Yeah.|b
A|Well, maybe this year you can find a more central location.|qy^d
B|Well, but the majority of them are in, like, just like how you said in close, close quarters.|arp_nd

B|Well, uh, how do you all communicate? Like to plan it and every thing.|qo
B|Do you all just call each other up on the phone and say this is the weekend we are going to do it,|qy
