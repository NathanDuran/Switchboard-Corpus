A|Uh, I basically, uh, listen to the news from the T V.|sd
A|That's probably the only time I get a chance to, uh, uh, take a look at it is the evening news|sd
A|and, and then if I'm lucky, I might be able to hear something through news wise.|sd
A|But, uh, other than that that's probably how I get my source unless something really tragic happens and somebody tells me it about through, uh, uh, you know, uh, through conversation or whatever|sd
A|but, uh, most of the time it is through the news in the evening|sd
A|so that's about the,|%
B|You don't get any newspapers?|qy
A|Newspapers?|br
A|No,|nn
A|I'm not too much in reading newspapers.|sd
A|Uh, not that I don't enjoy newspapers or anything like that|sd
A|but, uh, part of it is because I just don't feel like I need, the need to have them, uh, with watching the T V or whatever.|sd
A|We get our weekly news around the area|sd
A|and I might look through it real quick if there's something that catches my interest, uh, in regards to what's going on around the county or little bit of the state|sd
A|But the majority of the time now I don't get a daily newspaper where, you know, I get tons of, uh, news coming in that kind of stuff.|sd
B|I'm kind of the opposite of you.|sd
B|I get all my news from newspapers.|sd
A|Oh, you do|qy
B|We have, we have two newspapers.|sd
A|You read it in the morning then?|qy^d
B|Yeah.|ny
B|Two newspapers in the morning.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And, uh  I'm, uh, in, in a government position that I'm in the news a lot|sd
A|Sure.|b
B|so, uh, I, I kind of look through to see, see what, uh, I'm quoted in.|sd
A|Oh, sure|b
B|But, uh, how, how bad the quotes are every day.|sd
A|To see if they did it or if they, uh, criticize you or put something in there wrong.|^2
B|Yeah.|aa
A|Sure,|b
A|sure.|b
B|Or, uh, sometimes there's, uh, letter to the editor about me|sd
B|or there's a, even, uh, editorials  for and against what I'm doing|sd
A|Uh-huh,|b
A|Sure.|b
A|Sure,|aa
A|exactly|aa
B|But, uh, but T V, uh, the T V, I, I don't really watch, even if I'm, even if I'm on it.|sd
A|Uh-huh,|b
A|sure.|b
B|But just,|%
A|Well, that's, that's kind of like you said then.|sd
A|We, we are kind of on the opposite where I get home and, uh, while I'm cooking supper the T V is on and watching the news or trying to catch up with what is going on|sd
A|and, uh, very seldom do I catch the ten o'clock|sd
A|so, by that time, you know, old news is probably what I hear through the grapevine or whatever.|sd
A|But, uh, unless there is a big issue going on like when we were at war then I think everybody was glued to the T V to find out what was going on.|sd
B|Right.|b
A|But, uh, other than that, no.|sd
A|It's,|%
B|And that's,|%
B|C N N had the, uh,|sd
B|everybody was watching C N N,|sd
B|that seemed to be the place to be  to find out what was going on on that.|sv
A|Exactly,|aa
A|exactly,|aa
A|exactly,|aa
A|sure.|b
A|Yeah,|b
A|yeah.|b
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Yeah.|%
A|Yeah.|b
A|Well it brought kind of, uh, more of a vivid, uh, look at what was going on when they were dropping the bombs and just a lot of different things.|sv
A|But, uh, yeah,|aa
A|that's true.|aa
A|You know you know a lot of people that read the news to, newspapers to get the news of what's going on|sv
A|and, uh, other people that, you know, do it differently or don't even watch any news at all|sv
A|so. But,|%
B|Well, the thing is, with, with T V, I, I, uh,|sd
B|a lot of times the, the news on, uh, the local T V is so brief, you really don't get the full picture of what, uh, what's going on.|sv
A|Exactly happens.|^2
A|Sure,|b
A|sure.|b
A|That's,|%
B|And, uh, that's, that's a problem that I have is not, getting just a little brief, uh, idea of what's happening.|sv
B|But,|%
A|Oh sure,|b
A|a clip, you know, a sentence or two|sd
A|and that's about it of what went on|sd
A|and, uh, they have so much other information to cover in such a short period of time.|sd
A|Sure.|b
B|Right.|b
B|But  I like the weather report.|sd
A|Makes sense.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|So, I|%
B|I alway, always, I always turn that on|sd
A|Yeah,|b
A|yeah.|b
B|that's one part I watch because of, uh, I go surfing down here|sd
B|and I always want to watch the weather for when the waves are going to be good.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|So you're right on the coast line.|qy^d
A|You're not, uh, further up.|qy^d

B|Yeah.|b
A|Sure.|b
B|Yeah.|b
B|Weather channel's good|sv
A|Yeah,|ny
A|that's about the only time in the, in the summer, uh, if you're watching T V for the weather, even though it's very hard to predict what's going on,|sv
A|they'll kind of say, well, there's a thunderstorm warning or whatever.|sd
A|This is the, what is expected,|sd
A|but a lot of times things happen and change here so drastically, uh, so fast you know, where movement that was coming in has shifted or whatever|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|so.|%
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|so I can predict my, my week and where I'm going to be.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Sure.|b
B|So I can be at the, at the beach when the waves start coming in.|sd
A|to take off.|^2
A|Sure.|b
A|Yeah.|%
A|That's,|%
A|sounds pretty good|sv
A|so. Anyway, I don't know if our time is getting up here|sd
