A|I have about three books that I am going on.|sd

A|Reading that one last night.|sd
B|Oh, well that is interesting.|ba
B|Actually, I like to read also,|sd
B|but, uh, usually fall into one or two categories, either true science fiction or fantasy on the one hand or highly technical.|sd

B|Right.|aa
A|Well, that is great.|ba
B|And in the car,|%
