Here goes Sharon.
Okay.
Well what do you think about Nolan Ryan being the first baseball player to earn a million dollars?
That's the only thing I found out tonight
Oh, you found that out tonight?
Yeah.
I haven't even heard that,
that's great.
I think he deserves every penny of it.
Yeah.
But, there are some others out there that I don't believe deserve the money they're getting.
Well, isn't it funny how baseball's getting less than like football players would.
Oh, yeah.
Wonder because football,
And they play a lot, they play a lot longer season, too.
And a lot more games, right?
Yeah,
that's exactly right.
Uh-huh.
But I think, let's see,
the teams that were there last year were, see, somebody from California,
I don't even know who won the pennant last year.
Beats me.
I mean, I know Yankees have won a lot games through the years.
Yeah
Not lately though
We have been talking about this,
I tried to call earlier,
Uh-huh.
and we had made a list of all these, uh, baseball teams and the cities that they were from,
then I started cleaning
and I don't even know where I even put that paper
Threw it away
Yeah.
I was just cleaning and throwing,
Oh, gosh.
Let's see.
The teams that,
I think the A's were in it last year.
The Oakland A's, and I think it was, I don't think it was an all California baseball.
Well, have you ever played baseball?
I played softball.
Well, that's what I did when I was growing up.
Yeah.
That was fun.
Yeah,
that's fun
That's a whole different sport.
Uh-huh. in
Yeah,
let's see,
but I think, I think the Rangers need to go
and I think the Pirates will go.
And, uh, let's see,
Rangers have got a new guy this year,
I don't even remember his name either.
Do you ever go see the Rangers?
Every once in a while I, I like to go on the nights when there's not anybody out there, not very many people out there.
It's a lot more fun when your not fighting a crowd.
Yeah.
I think it's fun,
I like just looking at the billboards.
Yeah.
sometimes when I, if you go out there during the day, you just fry under the sun.
Yeah,
it's nice at night.
Yeah.
That's when I've been.
It is.
Well,
And do you know anything about that new stadium,
have you seen all those pictures that they're going to put out there?
No.
Yeah,
that, that huge
it's suppose to be a huge stadium
and it's going to have little shopping centers in it and little like a lake or something running through it.
And, uh, they're going to try to make it a real community center out there.
And your going to be able to buy your,
what was, no, wait about the liquor?
That's, that's in, uh, Texas stadium where the football players, play
Oh, yeah,
so you,
and they're never going to let liquor in there.
Well, they're trying.
I know,
but they try every year
and every year they get thrown out.
It's so stupid because they let you take it in there,
but they don't, they don't allow you to sell it, don't allow them to sell it there.
Uh-huh
But, uh, that new stadium's going to be real nice,
and I heard that there's, uh, that you can bid on that stadium
last night on the news I heard that they said you could, you could bid on the stadium to have it named after you,
so.
Uh-huh,
right.
And it's going to go to the highest bidder
Oh Well, that's the way to do it.
Yeah,
so that could be your, you know, fifteen minutes of fame.
You hear that?
That's my kids turning on their music.
Oh.
to child in the Holly turn it down.
I think it's the Bart man, the Simpsons
Oh, God I stay away from them.
I wish I could
I bet you do.
Well, where are you?
In Plano.
Okay,
I'm in Garland.
Oh, you are?
Yeah,
my my husband teaches in Plano.
Oh, what's he teach?
C V A E.
Uh-huh.
So, what do you do?
I teach,
but I teach for Dallas.
Oh, you do?
For right now.
I'm trying to get out.
Is that a tough system to be in?
Uh-huh.
Real hard?
Uh-huh.
Yeah,
I would think it,
I mean it's good because they, they try new things, you know,
but it's like, they'll try something
and then they throw it out, and get something else, you know,
Yeah.
and you get tired of that.
That's typical bureaucracy though.
That's, that's, I think it's going to be any where you go
it's just worse in the bigger cities than it is in the smaller ones,
Yeah.
I don't know,
sometimes the smaller ones are just as bad.
Well, but they can't be though,
they don't have as much money.
Yeah,
Most of the time.
but the politics, the politics gets worse in the small towns sometimes.
Oh man, in Dallas you don't even know who's in, in administration,
there's so many of them
You don't even know who to payoff, huh?
I mean, somebody walks in the, a classroom
and you don't know what they're there for, you know, when they're coming, how long they're going to be,
Yeah,
oh, how funny.
you know, it's just there they are
and they're writing the whole time
No communication whatsoever.
No.
I had them walk out of my class and not say their name anything,
and I finally just got to where I go, okay, I'm Debbie Moore, you know, may I ask who you are and what you are in my classroom for, you know.
Yeah.
Because, you know, you never know where they are going what they'll report
or,
I know.
and they'll tell you they've written something down,
and you hope they're telling you the truth.
And you never see it.
No
huh-uh.
That's got to be frustrating.
Oh, it is.
How long you taught, taught in Dallas schools?
Uh, this is my eleventh year.
Ugh, that's about, uh, ten too many.
No,
actually it's,
now my job's good, much better than a lot, because I'm Chapter One,
Yeah.
Uh-huh.
Yeah.
and all I do is teach reading all day long,
Oh.
and it's just ten children at a time.
Oh, well, that's not bad.
No.
It's good,
and you've got a lot of federal money, too.
But hasn't it changed a lot over the years?
Teaching?
Yeah.
Oh, yes.
Or working in the system.
Yes,
when I first started teaching, I remember I went to my
and I said, okay, I want to see a curriculum guide, you know,
so I'll know what I'm suppose to teach
and they go, we don't have one.
We don't even know where one is.
Oh, God
And so I go, okay, I mean, you just, you did what you wanted to do,
How funny.
and now they tell you what to teach and how long and, you know, what day, what period.
Yeah,
you don't know which is, you don't know, which is worse.
Yeah.
No,
I know which is worse.
Yeah,
I guess so.
Yeah,
being told what to do is worse.
Uh-huh.
So, how long are we suppose to talk for?
Well, you can talk for ten minutes
but you don't have to.
Oh, you can?
Yeah,
and no,
if you talk to ten then they come on and say, oh, you've extended your limit,
and please say good-bye within the next five seconds.
Oh, I haven't ever talked that long.
Well, you know, I hadn't either till last night, I was talking to this retired administrator from Cleveland, Ohio,
Uh-huh .
and we started talking about gangs, you know.
He lives in Cleveland?
Yeah.
Wow.
And, everybody else that I've talked to has been right around here.
Yeah.
But, she was real interesting.
Huh.
And then tonight this woman called,
have you taken any incoming calls?
yours is my second one.
Okay.
So hers was the first one I got, gotten
and, uh, and she was telling me all her problems, you know,
and it went over ten minutes.
Did she, did she, did you all not talk about the topic at all?
Well, yeah,
we did,
but the topic was boring I thought.
Oh.
What would you serve, uh, if you were having a dinner party?
Oh, gosh, all the other,
the one I talked about the other night was good,
it was, um, about movies, you know, what have you seen at the movies lately and stuff like that.
Oh yeah,
I could go on and on about that.
Me, too, because we go all the time,
the guy I was talking to never goes,
he was, boy it sounds like your really up on this.
I said, I see at least two a week
Ugh, neat.
So, that was real good to talk about that.
Have you seen like, uh, SILENCE OF THE LAMBS?
No.
You've got to go see that.
The last one I saw was DANCES OF THE, WITH THE WOLVES, WOLVES.
Yeah,
we talked about that one too.
And he, he said he didn't think it should have gotten all those awards, he thought it was too long
but I,
Oh, I enjoyed it.
I did, too.
I mean, it was just more for my money.
Yeah.
I didn't think it was too long at all.
Uh, he said after about the first hour he started looking at his watch.
Huh.
The other one you need to go see is SLEEPING WITH THE ENEMY.
Uh-huh.
And, how old are your kids?
One is eight
and one is eleven.
You probably don't want to take them to see SILENCE OF THE LAMBS.
It's, it's not, it's not too cool for kids.
They usually pick their own.
I bet they do.
You know, they've got it all figured out.
Yeah,
they want to see all the horror movies.
Well, and Ninja Turtles.
Yeah,
Ninja Turtles, got to have those.
But most of the time really we watch them on the video.
Oh, yeah,
you
that's,
Don't you?
Just massive rental.
well heck, that's a lot cheaper then, uh, taking them out to the show.
Going to,
I know.
Especially if you get them for a couple of nights you don't have to watch them all in one one time.
That's what we do, especially when it's bad weather, man, just, plug it in.
Yeah.
Of course, you have to get there early if you want to get anything, decent.
I know in
It's good when you go to Tom Thumb though
and they're cheap
and nobody has got them yet.
That's true.
Unbelievable
That's true.
We saw, um, HEROES HAVE ALWAYS BEEN COWBOYS, tonight.
Uh-huh.
It was okay,
it was kind of slow,
and I felt like it kind of got chopped off at the end, you know.
It just, it,
I don't know,
it one of those movies it's not going to be around long,
it will be a dollar movie in no time.
Do you read?
Not very much,
no.
No?
I don't have the patience to read
See I do that to make myself go to sleep at night.
Yeah.
Oh, my Mom and Dad read all the time.
You saw FIELD OF DREAMS, right, a long time ago?
Yeah,
sure did.
Well, I was reading the book,
and it's called SHOELESS JOE.
Oh, really?
It was so wonderful.
And then I was, um, I decided, well, I like this author,
so I got a, uh, book of his short stories,
and that's been real good.
Who is the, is the author?
Don't, don't ask me
Oh
The GHOST OF SHOELESS JOE was the name of the book.
Shoeless Joe.
Was it like the movie?
Yes,
Okay.
quite a, quite a bit.
But, you know, in the movie the guy was black,
Right.
he wasn't in the book,
Huh.
that's one difference.
There really wasn't a lot of difference.
I didn't,
see I never even heard that there was a book tied in with that movie.
That's interesting.
That was a good movie, too.
Well, do you think we covered baseball?
I think so
Okay,
well, have a good night.
