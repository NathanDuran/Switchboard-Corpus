What kind of books do you like best?
Well, I alternate between Danielle Steele is one of my very favorites
and, uh, then I try to go into one of the self improvement books.
Uh, we, we take books every once in a while in our Sunday school class and go through them.
Uh, I love Scott Peck and his ROAD LESS TRAVELED.
Huh, yeah,
I've heard of that one.
I don't think I've read it.
Oh, it is it is wonderful.
I, I thoroughly enjoyed that.
What do you read?
Well, uh, I'm a Tom Clancy fan.
Okay.
And I read,
I just finished a book on Novelle Netware, uh,
that's computer stuff.
I do a lot of computer reading
Oh, yes.
and, uh, I'm just finishing another one up on, uh, statistical sampling,
so, I do more work kind of related reading than, uh, just for enjoyment.
I, I try to keep a book going all the time.
Uh, I try to read when I first wake up in the morning and then before I go to sleep.
So I probably get, oh, thirty to fifty pages a day read.
Well, that's pretty good.
And I just, you know,
I don't feel like,
in fact this morning, I was almost late for work because I'm almost at the end of this book
and I didn't want to put it down
Oh, I've had them like that before, too.
But I like, I like mysteries.
Mysteries.
Any particular writer?
Uh, yes,
I like, uh, uh, oh,
I'm drawing a blank.
Uh, he wrote the, uh, BOURNE ULTIMATUM.
Ludwig,
Ludwig, yes.
Yes.
And, uh, I like Jeffrey Archer.
He is an English author who writes some mystery.
Uh, well, I guess they're, they're a type of mystery.
They're usually some
he's a ex-lawyer
so, or, he, he's a lawyer who no longer practices,
but his are all, have some part of the law, uh, enveloped in them.
So, you kind of learn something as well as enjoy yourself.
Right,
and then, uh, the new author that came out with, uh, oh, the one that, uh, Harrison Ford starred in.
RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK stuff.
No,
no,
it was the, uh,
Oh.
it's late,
I'm tired,
so I'm not thinking too well.
What, what time is it there, ten thirty?
Uh-huh.
Uh, it's nine thirty here.
Oh, it's, uh, it was his first book.
It came, it was on the top of the list, uh,
he was a D A.
Uh, PRESUMED INNOCENT?
Yes.
Oh, I haven't seen the movie, uh, or read the book
Okay,
and then he's, he came out with the second one.
Uh, a sequel to it.
And both of those I've enjoyed real well.
But I, I like that.
I love Danielle Steele
and, and, you know, if I want to get a fantasy and get away from it all.
Is she is she kind of racy?
No,
no,
she isn't at all.
Just feel good.
Her books, uh,
you always cry.
Oh, really?
I mean, it's, it's always good for good tears.
Uh, one book that she wrote that's good for both men and women is FINE THINGS,
my mother-in-law's a real fan of hers.
it's, it's always going to make you have a good cry
and you know it's going it turn out good
and you're going to be happy in the end
Oh, well, that's nice.
And I said, you know,
I don't want anything too real anymore.
I have enough of that in my own life.
I want, I want happy, fantasy
like.
Yeah.
Uh, you mentioned Sunday school Ladonna.
Uh-huh.
Uh, do you,
are you a BIBLE fan, too?
Uh, I, I do my share of it.
I, I certainly can't say that I understand a lot of it.
Oh, yeah,
but, uh, that's always a challenge.
So do you do,
my wife talks with other people,
