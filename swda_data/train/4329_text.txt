Okay,
so I guess it starts recording now.
Okay.
Okay.
I don't know, really know that much about the recycling in this area that we're in.
We live in the Saginaw area.
Saginaw?
Uh-huh.
And I'm not real familiar with, uh, anything that,
I,
fact as far as I know, the school doesn't have any kind of programs or anything out here. And, uh, or the grocery store or anything in this area,
Really?
yeah.
The
we live in Plano
and they started off recycling by, uh, putting the,
I think at each Wal-Mart, they had some recycling dumpsters and things like that, which now,
I guess the, uh, city is, has bought the big green trash cans
and, uh, we, they have a recycling truck that comes around now
and you separate your glass and paper and, uh, aluminum
Uh-huh.
and you set it out
and they pick it up
and it, it works real neat.
They seem to be having a real good response.
Really?
So,
That is pretty good.
I'm, we're originally from another state
and I know in the state we were from that they did that similar type thing.
The city brought ought, you know, set separate trash cans
and you separated your stuff
and you put it in there
and they took it, you know.
Did they, did they, like on bottles, did they give you a so many cents back for for cans
I don't really know.
I don't really know,
they, they started after we moved down here
and so I, I'm not really familiar.
Yeah.
I just know that, uh, my in-laws up in, up in Oklahoma, that's how they do, you know, they pick it up,
but I don't know if they get a, get anything back on it
or, do you get money for it?
No,
I just, I noticed it
Iowa and other cities like that, it's a nickel per aluminum can.
Oh.
So you don't see too many thrown out around the streets. Or even bottles.
Really
You know, all kinds of bottles they, they, they really charge people to, I guess when you purchase them and, and then when you turn them back in.
Right.
I I remember the old days as a kid where bottle was a nickel.
Right.
And now, now most of them are throwaway.
Right.
So, maybe that's one thing they can do.
I think now they're a lot more expensive than that.
Uh, I bought some Cokes the other day in the the little bottles you know,
Uh-huh.
and I think the bottles were like, I know they were at least ten cents apiece.
I to at home,
I was like, God, how much were those bottles you know?
Yes.
And, it was, they come in like, uh, eight and, and eight and ten packs, you know instead of six packs
Right.
and, uh, and they were like, it was like two dollars and something for the bottles.
You know, I was like God Almighty,
it costs more for the bottles than it did for the Cokes.
That was my brother's first job in a grocery store.
He was in the bottle area
In the
It's pretty dangerous out there, you know, when they fall over,
but but it's, uh, it's quite,
Right.
they say that the green glass now, that there's a big glut of green the green glass,
Oh, really?
Of green glass.
yeah.
It's amazing.
Well, out in this area, they really don't have anything.
Now, I know that like Minyard's and places like that around like Arlington and Fort Worth and a lot of those grocery stores, they have like four different bins out front. Uh, different colors for different things and, and things like that,
Uh-huh.
Right.
but I, I do know some of these places were doing that
and they discontinued them because people were coming and dumping their trash in them.
Right.
Yeah
it's,
I notice the plastic have sort of faded away, the milk jugs.
Yeah.
It, it's,
people just,
they, they really don't,
uh, there's too much labor involved I guess to separate the stuff.
Yeah,
more than it's worth.
It's,
I don't know,
it, it can be,
it's not as easy selecting, you know, clean junk as they say.
Right.
Well, who wants to clean their junk before they throw it away
That's right,
that's right.
It's like washing the dishes before you put them in the dishwasher.
Right,
uh, yeah.
We all do it
Well, it was nice talking to you.
It was nice talking to you.
I have no idea how long this is supposed to last or anything.
Oh, I think, I think two or three minutes is fine.
Is that it?
Yeah.
Okay,
well, it was nice talking to you
and I, I guess I'll do this for, I was doing this for, actually, I was going to do it for my son so that he could, uh, he, he's in high school, so that he could make some money.
Right.
Uh, but then it has my name on it,
so I'm like, okay,
I'll sit down here and call it
Well, we're doing it for a church choir
so,
Oh, are you?
Yeah.
Oh, that's interesting.
So,
That's nice.
Well,
Well, thank you.
Thank you.
Bye.
Bye-bye.
