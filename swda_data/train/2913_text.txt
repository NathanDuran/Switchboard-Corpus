Okay,
well what movies do you like?
Gosh,
I like just about anything.
We, I think the last one we saw was, uh, TEENAGE MUTANT NINJA TURTLES PART TWO.
Oh, now, I I like the turtles.
My little boy's four
and he loves them.
Well, we don't have any kids
but we like them anyway.
Oh, that's okay.
How old are you all?
Um, we're late twenties.
Oh, and you just don't have any yet,
okay.
No.
Well I've got two.
Oh, gosh.
Yeah,
my little girl is three months old
and my little boy just turned four.
I had his birthday party yesterday.
Oh.
But he's a turtle fanatic.
He even had turtle cake yesterday
But I've been wanting to see TURTLE TWO.
Is it as good as they say it is?
It was,
it was actually better than the first one, I thought.
Good.
What's the last movie you saw?
GHOST.
Oh
we were just, when, when the topic came up, we, I was asking my husband right quick, what's the last movies we saw.
He said well GHOST and TURTLES.
I really liked it.
Now GHOST,
yeah,
I love tearjerker movies.
But that wasn't too bad on tearjerker
but, It was, oh, it was good movie,
Not too awful bad.
Yeah.
Because that was just so good.
And I like Demi Moore.
Did you see PRETTY WOMAN?
No,
but I've been hearing a lot about it.
I we don't get to the video store very often
and we don't have cable.
Oh, gosh.
Well we don't really want cable,
it's just, you know, glued to the T V all the time anyway.
Yeah.
So we get two channels down here.
I'm from Kentucky originally,
Uh-huh.
and we used to get five channels without cable.
Yeah.
You know, forty,
well I don't think you all have the same channels,
but here in Texas we only get two channels,
and that's, um,
do you watch soap operas?
Uh, once in a while, when I'm home.
Okay,
you work then?
Yeah.
Okay,
well we get the channel with YOUNG AND THE RESTLESS on it.
Okay.
And then, uh, I think GENERAL HOSPITAL
and that comes on different channel.
Yeah,
it does.
But that's all we get,
and that's no cartoons for my little boy.
But we've got a V C R and a lot of tapes.
Yeah.
And, uh, my husband is a movie fanatic.
I think you would really like PRETTY WOMAN,
it was, it was really a,
it made you feel really good.
It was just a happy movie.
Oh, what about TOTAL RECALL,
have you seen that.
Yeah,
I saw that one.
That's good.
I, I was disappointed in it just because of how violent it was.
Yeah,
it was violent.
I try to get away from that.
My little boy, oh, he loves ROBO COP.
And that movie, I have to, I'll fast forward it every time they come to the part where there is,
have you seen it?
Yeah.
The part where they're shooting mercy .
I don't like that.
That, oh, that's horrible,
that is horrible
and their, their, the language on that's filthy.
I don't see why they have to do that,
I mean, I mean everybody knows that it, that the, the language is there so they could just ignore it and, you know, use different words instead, I think.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah,
yeah,
I know.
But I, I think lately PRETTY WOMAN'S been my favorite.
I went and bought the video.
I've probably seen it about fifteen or twenty times.
Um, my husband bought me, like, um, uh, I think PRETTY IN PINK for my birthday.
With, a,
wait a second,
I will in a minute Kyle, to child in the
Sorry.
That's okay.
Uh, he bought me PRETTY IN PINK.
Just a second.
the phone and talks to Sorry,
now, you're glad you ain't got a four year old.
That's okay
Now, Now I haven't seen PRETTY IN PINK, Molly Ringwald? *br
It this is the first time he's interrupted my phone calls.
Molly Ringwald.
Yeah.
It was cute,
but, it wasn't,
I like the, um, SIXTEEN CANDLES, or sixteenth birthday or,
I think, I think SIXTEEN CANDLES was the name of it.
Yeah,
oh, that was so good.
Of course I was a teenager when I seen that
and I loved it.
I haven't seen it either.
Oh, well if you like love stories, it's sweet.
I do.
Oh, it's sweet,
it really is
And that's a tearjerker
it gets you,
I mean it makes you feel really sorry for her.
Oh, gosh.
But it's hilarious too, especially with that, uh, little guy in it.
Oh he looks like little, I don't know, he looks like a little boy next door,
Oh.
but he's sixteen.
Oh, it's a cute movie.
I can't remember his name.
He kind of looks like DOOGIE HOWSER.
Huh, I don't know.
Don't know either.
He's got curly blonde hair,
he just a little freckly, little boy.
Probably know him if I saw him.
Yeah,
if I could remember the name, I know you'd know his name, because he's played in a few movies.
But, uh,
I was just thinking another good one I saw not too long ago was, um, SLEEPING WITH THE ENEMY.
Okay,
I've heard about that
but I can't remember it.
That, that's, that's Julia Roberts' new movie.
Okay,
yeah,
Julia Roberts is good.
Yeah
she's,
this one,
you know PRETTY WOMAN was kind of a light comedy and a romance,
Uh-huh.
and, and this one was a lot more dramatic.
Wasn't it a murder mystery?
well,
Like, sort of
it was like, uh, it was a, it was a mystery.
She disappeared from her uh, husband who was abusing her.
Oh, okay,
the, yeah, that's the one I wanted to see where he was on, she was on a carnival, at a carnival on a Ferris wheel or something.
Yeah,
yeah.
Well did that come on T V
or did it come out in the,
No,
it came out in the theater.
Oh.
And I think, you know, around here, it's all ready quit playing.
But I don't, I don't know if it's still playing any where else.
Well I, I think,
But it was, it was, it was one of those that kept you on the edge of your seat.
Real good.
I want to see that.
Yeah,
I seen the, uh, previews for it on T V down here,
but it's just been down here a couple weeks, I think.
Oh, okay,
Yeah.
because we saw it, probably, four or five months ago.
A month
Well I know it hasn't been that long since I've seen the previews for it,
but yeah,
I wanted to see it.
Her husband was a, dark haired guy with a beard and moustache,
or
no
he shaved the beard off.
Yeah,
he's, uh, he was a real psycho in the movie.
Yeah.
It was, it was scary.
Oh, I'd like to see that.
What about, oh,
there was a,
we got one back here a while,
I want to see WAR OF THE ROSES too,
have you seen that?
Oh yeah,
boy I, I didn't like it.
You didn't?
No,
it was,
I didn't like the way it ended.
I know,
well the only reason I know why it ended is on ARSENIO HALL one night, Christopher Reeves told, that, you know,
Uh-huh.
I can't believe they killed them.
Or, or who was it
Christopher Reeve or Mike Douglas.
Might have been Michael Douglas. Oh, that starred in it. *listen
Yeah.
Yeah,
it was Michael Douglas.
Christopher Reeve wasn't in it at all?
Huh-uh.
Okay.
Well Arsenio Hall is the one that jumped up and said that I can't believe they killed them
and Christopher Reeve, or, Mike Douglas went after his throat, you dummy
So I know that they die,
but I haven't told my husband.
We've both been wanting to see it.
It was, I, I, it was, it was weird.
It was a different movie from anything I've ever seen.
well we was, uh, teasing, about, you know, splitting our house down the middle
Yeah
They did that didn't they
and they marked off routes that they could go or something
Yeah,
that would be kind of hard for us,
we've only got one bathroom,
I don't know
We've got two bathrooms
but, well
actually, if he takes,
my house kind of looks like two trailers put together.
And one bathroom is at the end of one side
and one's in the middle of the other,
so we could do it.
That wouldn't be too bad.
No,
and he could climb out the window
and we, our whole house has, you know,
every room leads to three rooms,
so we can, you know
Get around.
yeah,
you can get around
You just can't go out the front door honey,
sorry.
Well did you see FATAL ATTRACTION?
Yeah,
that's coming back, on too
I know it's going to be on, on the, on C B S Tuesday night
an, and that's kind of what, in a way, you know, how it kind of bothered you, the way it ended and stuff.
Uh-huh.
That's kind of how WAR OF THE ROSES was.
Huh, I,
Parts of, parts of WAR OF THE ROSES was funny
but then other times it was like it was just deadly serious,
and it just left you with this kind of uneasy feeling, you know.
Eerie feeling,
or, I want to see it though.
I'd like to see that and, uh, THE NEVER ENDING STORY, came out on Disney this month, I think.
I I've heard about that
I wanted to see that.
but I don't know what it's about.
THE NEVER ENDING STORY?
Yeah.
It's a child's movie,
but, oh, it's good,
I enjoyed it.
I love Disney movies.
Yeah,
I do too Yeah,
I mean, they're some of the best of, that are made.
yeah.
And, uh, well it's about this little boy who, uh,
I think he's up in a attic, or some part of school.
He got locked in the school
and he got scared,
but he starts dreaming
and then, uh, he's saving the land of, uh, oh,
it's been so long since I've seen it.
All I know, all's I can really remember is him flying this great big dog, this great big huge sheep dog sort of looking thing,
Oh
it flies through the air.
And he's trying to save the land from some, ooze
But it's really good,
I mean it sounds
it, it had, uh, Fred Savage in it.
No,
no,
no,
no,
no.
Did you see that movie with Fred Savage in it, though,
I don't think so.
with, uh, oh,
he had, uh, uh,
oh it was THE PRINCESS BRIDE.
Nope,
I didn't see that.
You didn't see that,
that was cute,
that was real, that was a good one.
I, I like, I like slapstick comedy.
So do I
and a lot of times we'll go to rent a movie or something
and, and you're not sure whether it will be any good or not
so sometimes we stick with the stuff we've heard more about than,
Yeah,
well I heard,
a friend of mine told me she got NAKED GUN last night
and she said that was hilarious.
Yeah,
now, we saw that,
and and they're coming out with a sequel to it.
Two and a half *is this a title??
It was funny.

I want to see that.
She said she rented it last night
and said it was real good
an,
And, and WORKING GIRL is really good.
Now, I seen that,
That was good.

she pretended to be the boss or something.
Yeah.
Yeah,
