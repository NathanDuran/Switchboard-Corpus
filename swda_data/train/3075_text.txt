Lynn, do you, do you want to start?
Certainly.
Okay.
Um,
Do you want to tell me about vacations you've taken
or,
Well, I, I tend to, uh, take two kinds of vacations, the vacations to visit family and the vacations to just have a week being cultural and going to the theater and doing sight-seeing and things like that.
Uh-huh.
Which is your favorite?
Oh, well, I couldn't live without the family vacations,
but, uh, my favorite is the, the indulgent ones, where we go off and, and, uh, see places that have interested me since I was a kid, for the most part.
Uh-huh.
And, uh,
Your family doesn't live close, then?
Uh, not anymore.
They, uh, they've been in San Diego for the last few years,
and they're moving to Florida.
Okay.
And that's one of those things,
you just have to go once a year.
Yep,
I understand.
So, uh, basically it, it sorts out into that,
and then once, about once every three or four years I try to get over to England, because I lived there for a while, some years back.
Wow.
I've only been there once.
Oh.
and I'd love to go back.
Beautiful country.
Beautiful country,
And it was,
beautiful people.
Yeah,
it,
But, uh,
and I'd real,  really like to go  because, um, I'm fairly recently married
we had a great time.
and, and my husband has been hearing about these people for years
and, uh, but he's never met them,
so, uh, I'd like, I'd like to do that.
But anyway, that's, that's our typical vacation,
and, uh, we enjoy the family vacations,
but the other ones are very special getaways,
and we probably take one of each every year.
How about yourself?
Well, uh, we, we, as you do, take family vacations, uh, sometimes one a year,
and, but this year we're not going to be taking one for several reasons.
But vacations we really enjoy,
I think we've been on three cruises.
Oh, I've never, been on a cruise.
And we, we really love cruises.
We've gone on CARNIVAL CRUISE LINES.
Uh-huh.
And, uh, we've gone fairly inexpensive from, as most cruises go.
Uh, we usually book just a month before it's ready to go.
Yeah.
And we get upgraded.
Last last two times, in fact, we had an outside room
and it was beautiful.
Um.
And we like not having to take our suitcase in and out of hotel rooms and drag it all around.
It's kind of,
Well, what do you do on a cruise?
I've never been on a cruise.
Oh, my God, you do everything.
You, I mean, you can be as busy as you want to be, or as laid back as you want to be.
You can sit in the sun all day around the pool,
or you can take part in the games that they have going on.
They always have bingo.
They have a casino.
Uh, they have a massage parlor.
They have exercise,
I mean, you can do anything.
Huh.
And that's just aboard ship.
And then when the ship docks, you get to go sight-seeing and shopping.
Uh-huh.
And that's quite fun.
Uh-huh.
And where have you been on these cruises?
Uh, Nassau, San Juan, Saint Thomas.
We've been there twice.
We went two cruises that hit those islands, but with different people.
We, we've gone with friends each time.
I see.
And then we went to, uh, the western Caribbean, which is, uh, Port, uh, Cancun, Cozumel,  and Ocho Rios.
Oh, the, the Mexican coast.
Pardon me?
That's all Mexico, I think.
Yes,
uh-huh.
And, but it was wonderful.
So we really like those.
And, uh, I guess we just like to go someplace, someplace entirely different.
We've been to a few places in this country.
We still have a lot to see, though.
Where are you from originally?
We're from Illinois originally.
Uh-huh.
And we've been down in Texas eighteen years,
and so, like you, we always try to make it, you know, back home to see the relatives.
We both still have family there.
Uh-huh.
And that's fun.
It brings back a lot of memories.
Oh, yes.
Uh, things are different there, though.
They're, uh,
I don't know.
It's just entirely different world than this
Well, I, I grew up in Dallas,
so I mean, it's not, it's not like I'm going home.
Did you?
My, my parents retired first to San Diego,
Uh-huh.
and they're going now to Florida,
and so they're going very nice places,
thank God,
Uh-huh.
that will be a pleasure to visit and get to know.
I really came to love San Diego and feel very, comfortable there.
They've been there eight years.
Uh-huh.
And, uh, you know, I just grab the car and drive everywhere.
Oh, that's great.
So it, it is, it is nice,
but it's not home.
This is home,
and, um, and I've never thought about a cruise.
It's so funny.
Oh, they, they, they really are.
We've, yeah, as I said, we've done them three times.
We'd be going again this, this year if circumstances hadn't changed.
We, we'd probably go.
Uh-huh.
My husband would, you know,
the minute I said the word, he, he, he's chomping at the bit.
He kind of likes the casinos a little bit.
Uh-huh.
But I like all of that.
What's the best part, from your point of view?
I like seeing other countries and shopping in other places.
Uh-huh.
I like shopping.
I can shop anyplace, shop in London and France and wherever.
Now, my kids are moving to Toronto,
so we're going to be able to go up there.
Oh, that will be nice.
So I'm kind of looking forward to that, except I hate to see them go.
Oh, sure.
But,
Sure.
Well, go in, don't go in the winter.
Oh, that's what everybody says,
and I, I think it's,
I think I'll try to stay away, except my, my second grandchild will be born in in the winter in January.
Oh.
So that will be hard to stay away from.
Well, there are exceptions made for special occasions like that.
Yeah.
But the ordinary thing is to stay out of the north in the winter and get out of Texas in the summer
so,
Isn't that the truth,
uh-huh.
Huh. Well, that sounds wonderful.
I, I guess I, I would contemplate going on a cruise, uh, oh, all circumstances permitting it.
Well, there's all age groups too,
and that's, that's kind of fun.
Uh, you, if you sit at a table with a lot of people for your meals, you meet different people.
Uh-huh.
You may meet people, you know, thirty years older than you, or younger,
and everybody is really interesting,
and everybody is there to have a good time
and,
Huh. How long are the cruises?
Uh, we've only gone on the seven day cruises.
Uh-huh.
They have shorter ones
and then they have ten day ones.
But I think seven days is long enough for us.
By that time we're ready to get home and get back to our routine.
Yeah.
I think most vacations, uh, seven days is enough for us.
We've gone,
I think when we went to England and France, we were there ten, twelve days,
and that was pushing it a bit.
Yeah.
Uh, I tend, when, when I spend enough money to go overseas
I, go for a long time.
Yeah.
Well, that, that makes sense, it really does.
I mean, oh, we went to Panama too.
Oh, that's interesting.
Went to Panama last August.
Uh-huh.
Our son-in-law is from Panama.
Oh.
And, uh, we went with our daughter and son-in-law to visit his parents, who live there.
Uh-huh.
And his father is a, a doctor
and his mother is a kindergarten teacher,
and they took time off,
it was their winter
and they were having a little break,
so they took some time off that, uh, they could show us around.
And it, it is a beautiful country.
Huh.
It is beautiful.
They have mountains.
We were an hour away from the mountains or an hour away from the shore.
That's really nice.
And it, it is gorgeous.
They live in a small town called David, which is northern Panama up near Costa Rica.
Uh-huh.
And, uh, it's, it's just, it's just a gorgeous country.
Most people don't realize it.
I think if they could get tourists coming to their country, they'd improve the economy considerably.
Huh. Well, may, maybe now things are calming down again. That will happen.
Yeah.
We really hope, hope so.
Well, that, that's really great. Uh,
Yeah.
I, I mean, as I said, basically all I've done is go back and forth to parents
and, uh,
Well, that, that's, that's pretty good.
That's pretty good.
And, and, uh, we had, my husband had a conference in L A,
so we spent a week in L A
and of course,
Oh, do you like L A?
Uh, I'm, I'm, I'm very unusual.
I like,
