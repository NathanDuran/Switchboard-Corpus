A|Go ahead.|ad
A|So Ken, how do you do your family budget?|qh
B|Well, we don't actually have a budget, budget per se.|sd
B|What we do is, uh, maintain a normal checkbook. You know, like, everyone in the world does, I guess,|sd
A|Huh-uh.|b
B|and occasionally it actually balances,|sd
B|And, um, we also, we, um, we have a, a U S Air and Visa card.|sd
A|Huh-uh.|b
B|Every, every dollar we, every dollar we charge is a mile for our frequent flier mileage.|sd
A|Oh, yeah.|b
B|It's a real good deal actually, if you charge a lot.|sd
B|So what we, what my wife and I have taken to doing is charging everything in sight.|sd
B|Anything we buy, we charge, including groceries and so forth.|sd
A|Huh-uh.|b
B|So what we'll do is,|sd
A|Well, then you just pay it off at the end of the month?|qy
B|Right.|na
B|We actually maintain a,|sd
B|we have, a, we, we, we, we have a checking account that we treat like a savings,|sd
B|scratch that,|ad
B|we have a savings account that we treat like a checking account.|sd
A|Huh-uh.|b
B|And so what we do is, we anytime we do or make or charge something, we write it out as if we wrote a check.|sd
A|Huh-uh.|b
B|And then at the end of the month all the money to covered already.|sd
B|So we just pay it off without having to worry about any interest or anything.|sd
A|Oh.|b
A|That's a real good idea.|ba
B|It keeps us hopping.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
A|See, now I'd never get my wife to be able to follow that.|sd
A|Before we got married I had money in the bank.|sd
A|I owned my own home.|sd
A|I put in so much money, each, you know, month towards long term savings, you know, like in, uh, mutual funds and things, you know,|sd
B|Huh-uh.|b
A|and, uh, after I got married,|sd
A|no,|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
A|it just didn't work anymore.|sd
A|She spends a lot.|sd
A|She likes to spend on anything and everything With body lotion, everything|sd
A|So, we really haven't, we don't have a good organized system, yet.|sd
A|Maybe after awhile I'll rub off on her or something|sd
A|I don't think,|%
B|Well, you know, you know, you know, what's always good is sort of a for savings , where they just take money out of you're pay.|sv
A|Yeah.|b
B|We did that for awhile where, um,|sd
B|we actually still do it with, with my wife's salary,  where we put it, we have a separate, a third account even, a savings account in, in an entirely different bank where what we do is take money out of her paycheck every week.|sd
B|I'm a graduate student.|sd
A|Yes.|b
A|So am I.|sd
B|Oh, really.|b
B|In what field?|qw
A|Well, uh, in information systems.|sd
A|I'm a voice researcher.|sd
B|Oh, okay.|bk
B|I'm in, uh, psycholinguistics, actually.|sd
A|Huh-uh.|b
B|Um, but my wife has a real job.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
A|So does mine.|sd
B|Yeah|b
B|What we do is, we take money out of her, out of her paycheck each week.|sd
A|Huh-uh.|b
B|And put it, it goes directly to another account, that we don't, at an entirely different bank, that we don't have access to so easily,|sd
B|and it goes there|sd
B|and it stays there|sd
B|and it builds up until we need it for something.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
A|See, I think we might have to do that|sd
A|Of course, she looks at what she brings home each week.|sd
A|It's going to be hard for her to, uh, not have her own money. Because, like now, you know, I put money in the bank and saved to go back to graduate school for two years.|sd
A|And now she wants to go back to school,|sd
A|but she saved enough maybe to get her through August.|sd
B|Oh.|b
A|You know, and that's it.|sd
A|And I keep saying, now, Laura, you're going to have to save a little money.|sd
A|I don't know if my paltry graduate student fees are going to get us through.|sd
A|It doesn't work, Ken|sd
B|Gee.|b
A|My mother always said, "now, don't argue about money",|sd
A|so we don't.|sd
B|Right.|b
A|But, you know, there goes my savings|sd
B|God.|ba
A|But, you know, it's one of those things.|sd
B|I got lucky.|sd
B|My wife apparently is not a,|sd
B|she likes to spend,|sd
B|but she's pretty good about things.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
A|Now, see my wife will do things like make clothes.|sd
B|Wow.|ba
A|One of our, one of our big investments that, you know, I was wholeheartedly in favor of, was to buy a sewing machine. Because she makes clothes.|sd
A|And, you know, a descent sewing machine will really help her out|sd
A|and she's already made, you know, presents and gifts and things for,  shorts for me and things for the summer.|sd
A|You know, so I guess I can't, you know, we've probably almost paid off the sewing with, uh,  yeah, with the savings from that.|sd
A|So I can't complain too much, you know,|sd
A|she's, she's good about that.|sd
A|And, also, we, we dine at home a lot.|sd
A|You know, she likes to cook.|sd
A|So that saves us from restaurants or whatever|sd
A|but,  but, she does have things where she likes to pamper herself that just to me seem like money dumped down a drain. You know.|sd
B|Right.|b
B|Well, I guess we all have those feelings.|sv
A|Yeah.|b
B|I, uh, I uh, I, I go to, uh,|%
B|I pay what I think is a lot of money to go to a karate class, you know.|sd
A|Huh-uh.|b
A|You know, but you need a hobby.|sv
B|Right.|b
B|Exactly,|ba
B|but that to her is sort of like a waste.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
A|That's true.|ba
B|But she does her nails.|sd
B|So,|%
A|I know,|ba
A|and those nails are so expensive|sd
A|Oh, gosh.|ba
A|I was so excited when she decided she wasn't going to do her nails anymore.|sd
A|I guess she just stopped polishing them because they were yellow.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|And then she waits for them to get their color back.|sd
A|And then she'll polish them again.|sd
A|I don't know, whatever.|sd
A|So she stopped for awhile.|sd
A|Boy, what a difference.|sd
A|They buy nail polish every two weeks,|sd
A|it's, uh,|%
A|my gosh,|ba
B|Yeah.|b
A|And lotion, oh, my goodness, body lotion,|sd
B|Oh, yeah.|b
A|we spend more on soft, on, on body lotions with sesame oil and all these different things, than, uh,|sd
A|she must spend more on one application of body lotion than I do on soap for an entire year.|sd
B|Yeah|b
B|Good old Ivory|sd
A|Yeah.|b
A|It's funny.|sv
B|Um, well, it's for your benefit though, right.|qy
A|Oh, I think so,|na
A|she's always soft.|sd
A|That's true.|sd
B|, so that's helpful.|ba
A|Yeah.|aa
A|But I think, um,|%
A|I don't know,|h
A|maybe after we're not in school anymore, we'll be much better at saving.|sd
A|I think, uh,  I think that's, uh,|%
B|Yeah.|b
B|Now do you still own a house?|qy
B|You said you owned one.|sd
A|I sold my house.|ng
A|And that's what's really paying for my time unemployed or whatever. Because the graduate assistantship really doesn't cover, the ten thousand dollars in tuition, really doesn't cover living expenses. Um,|sd
B|That's great.|ba
B|Right.|b
A|we actually live in two different places right now because she has her job.|sd
A|So that makes it hard with, uh, you know,|sd
A|we're paying double rent, double utilities,|sd
B|Oh, wow.|ba
A|and that makes it sort of expensive|sd
A|but see, I live within my,  I live within my very menial income|sd
A|and she doesn't|sd
A|She doesn't live within her professional income, you know.|sd
A|So I just get a,|%
B|that's the killer, two apartments,|sv
A|yeah,|aa
A|and then even if we want to see each other on weekends, it's twenty-five, thirty dollars in gas, every weekend,|sd
A|and that really adds up too, you know,|sd
A|so it gets tough,|sd
B|Wow.|ba
A|I think, we'll, do much better when we're living together and we're only paying one rent and one telephone.|sd
A|You know, it will cut our telephone bills, you know, by five, by four-fifths, you know,   if she's here,|sd
B|Eventually, right.|ba
B|I mean you're not going to,|%
B|Right.|b
A|so it's actually tough this year,|sd
A|but it will be better in June.|sd
A|She will move in with me in June,|sd
A|so hopefully our budget will in increase then.|sd
B|Have you been married for long?|qy
A|No.|nn
A|Just since December.|sd
B|Oh, wow.|ba
B|So you guys really are newlyweds.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
A|We're, very newlyweds,|sd
A|but that's the,|%
A|we, we're together probably for, um, uh, very close for about six months before we got married.|sd
A|So, you know, we lived within,|%
A|though I had my own house and things, you know, we still, uh, we're still pretty close.|sd
A|I knew her spending habits|sd
A|and they're about the same|sd
B|Oh, wow.|ba
A|they haven't changed at all, you know.|sd
A|My mother always said to me, "Tom, now, the best thing to do is be like you're father.|sd
A|Never say a word when you're wife spends money".|^q
A|And I was like, well, that's true my dad never said a word, you know.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|So.|%
B|I actually encourage my wife to spend money sometimes. Because I think, you know, um, I sort of feel guilty, you know, given that she makes twice as much as I do.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|So I say if she wants to go out and buy something, I never argue with her, because she's real good at, you know, sort of .|sd
A|I don't argue with her,|sd
A|but I just get all,|sd
A|it must show in my face.|sd
A|Must be like, must be cringes or something, you know,  especially yesterday or this past weekend.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|We met half way between, at her parents house|sd
A|and, um, she had on a new pair of jeans|sd
A|and she'd gotten all new underwear,|sd
A|and I was like, Laura.  How did you get all this stuff?|sd
A|imitates a woman's "Well, I just got paid."|^q
A|And, and I was like, oh.|sd
B|Had some money in her pocket, yeah.|ba
A|It was there.|sd
A|It was burning.|sd
A|It had to be spent.|sd
A|You know, and I'm like|%
A|and she said everything was on sale.|sd
A|Oh, oh, that's good,|ba
A|at least it was on sale|sd
A|That's good honey,|^q
A|I'm glad you bought it on sale|^q
A|What else can you say?|bh
B|That's right.|ba
B|I do recommend the for savings bit.|sv
B|They, uh, they take it out or your paycheck before you see it because it doesn't hurt.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
A|I think,|%
A|Yeah.|b
A|You don't notice it.|sd
A|I think that's probably a really good idea.|sd
B|You know, you don't even think about it if it's gone.|sv
A|Huh-uh.|b
B|Yeah,|b
B|so, uh, until you really need it|sd
B|and then you realize, you've got a couple of thousand dollars built up someplace else.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
A|Yeah,|b
A|see I was,|%
A|when I had, when I was living alone and I had my own house and things, uh, I put one, I was paid twice a month,|sd
A|one paycheck went into savings|sd
A|and one went into the checking account that paid the mortgage,  and the food bills|sd
B|Right.|b
A|and it,|%
A|and I was even able to, you know, to accumulate some savings in a sense in the checking account, because I'm pretty thrifty|sd
A|and, you know. But my wife likes to spend.|sd
A|She enjoys,|sd
A|so that's fine|sd
A|But a|%
A|for savings , I'll have to look into that.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
B|that's, that's been our godsend, you know.|sd
A|Huh-uh.|b
B|We've had some sort of major emergencies come up, you know, where,|sd
B|we also own our own house,|sd
A|Huh-uh.|b
B|um, we had an ice storm up here,  recently, where it was I mean, it was horrible.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|I mean, half the city owned trees .|sd
B|One-third of all vegetation in this county is just wiped out.|sd
A|Oh, really, because of the heavy ice.|qy^d
B|Yeah.|ny
A|It broke the limbs.|sd
B|Exactly.|aa
A|Huh-uh.|b
B|We had to our backyard tremendous willow tree that just fortunately,|sd
B|but it cost us, you know, a couple of hundred dollars just to bring the tree down. I mean, just to take off what was broken.|sd
A|Right.|b
B|Plus, we went with a friend,|sd
B|and they said you know,|%
B|and then the whole ice storm cost us quite a bit of money, even though insurance picked up some of it,  still, not all of it.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|They don't get, you know,|%
A|Huh-uh.|b
B|and that,|%
B|plus|%
B|and then we had a car expense like that same week.|sd
B|One of the cars died, you know.|sd
B|All of this adds up|sd
B|and that for savings really comes in handy.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
A|Yeah.|b
A|I can see that.|ba
A|I can that,|%
A|I keep trying to say to her, Laura don't spend so much.|sd
A|What happens if something happens to a car, you know.|^q
B|Right.|b
A|Oh, well, nothing will happen.|sd
A|Oh.|%
