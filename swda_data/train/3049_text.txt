What was one of the latest ones that you've seen, actually?
Oh, I I think we rented PRETTY WOMAN a couple weeks, months ago.
Uh.
Right.
The last two years, I have done more theater movie going than I have actually watched videos at home.
I've, uh,  uh,  become available to come and go more often,
Uh-huh.
so I said "hey, it's worth it,
I'll just go at the matinee hour
and I can see what I please."
Yeah.
It's no more costly than renting one.
The last,
see I went about two or three weeks ago and saw F X TWO
and that is a really good movie, if you like special effects,
kind of gory and lots of, you know action.
Uh-huh.
I have not done that one,
I don't know if I have even heard of that one.
Um, do you know that I don't follow performers,
Oh.
I  don't follow actors.
Some I know,
Uh-huh.
some  I don't.
Yeah.
Uh, and he was
the guy, the guy that played in it, he was not the star, but the one that played in it that I liked best was the one who was in, uh, oh, the one about the old people.
COCOON?
COCOON,
uh-huh.
Okay.
He was a blond haired, heavyset alien in COCOON.
Oh, okay.
I don't, I don't know what his name is.
Uh, I think I know who you are talking about though.
Yeah.
At any rate, I also saw not long ago ONCE AROUND.
That was with Richard Dreyfuss.
Okay.
And, that one was just a very poignant story,
it, it, it had people,
it was, it was you know, a lot of people said it was a really funny movie,
but it was,  a  very, it was a poignant humor
Uh-huh.
and there was, it was like, uh, uh, STEEL MAGNOLIAS.
The characters played very well off one another.
Uh-huh.
And there was humor involved,
but the story was a very dramatic story,
and I enjoyed it very much.
What are some others that you have seen lately?
Oh, I'm trying to think, uh,
just the other night on H B O we watched THE HUNT FOR RED OCTOBER,  again
Oh, whoa,
yes.
and that's  one that,
That's one I can watch,  over  and over and over again.
Yeah.
I was going to read while it was on,
but then when it started, I just couldn't, you know, read.
That was a really good movie.
It sure was.
And, you know, the second time you see it, you understand more subtleties in it.
There are a number of good movies like that.
Yeah,
there's quite a few, uh, movies out now that I would like to go see.
My husband,  is  not a real big movie goer,
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
and  I guess, more than anything, that is why we don't go.
Yeah.
Plus, by the time you get a baby-sitter, and then pay to go to the movies it just gets pretty expensive.
Uh-huh.
Right.
You don't work?
No,
I stay at home.
Okay.
Well, you are going to have to find a mother's day out and have him call in sick one day.
Yeah.
Go during the day,
that's right.
That's right.
There's nothing wrong with that.
Go in the early hours,
it's a matinee,
it's not crowded
and the price is as reasonable as renting a video.
Yeah.
And that's the way I do it
and I go quite frequently.
Uh-huh.
If you are going to be planning on doing that,
now I was WARLOCK too, which is supposed to be the story of a, uh, witch hunt that is, you know, magically shot into the present time.
Uh-huh.
And, the first five minutes or ten minutes of the movie was, I was very well persuaded to walk out. Very well persuaded,
there was more gore than I was interested in seeing.
Uh-huh.
But, as the movie settles down to a comfortable action, uh, I can't really that it would have gotten more than a star and a half from me either.
But,  uh,  the action was comfortable
Yeah.
and, of course, I enjoyed those good guy, bad guy type conflicts things.
So, I enjoyed that movie, after the first few minutes of gore.
And there were some others,
but they were done a little more tastefully.
Yeah.
But, uh, in the first scene, the warlock chopped off a guy's finger because he wanted the ring and then bit his tongue out and spit it off in the omelet
Uh.
and I could not handle that.
I said "whoa, I'm glad I have not had dinner".
Then, uh, I saw AWAKENING,
that's a wonderful, wonderful job by Robin Williams and Peter De Niro.
I, uh, I, uh,
Robert De Niro?
Robert De Niro,
what did I say, Peter?
I think you said Peter.
I said Robert De Niro.
Yeah.
And, he has done a really good job of characterizing the, uh, disabled person.
Uh-huh.
And, of course, Robin Williams always just has a, an air about him that you can't help but enjoy what he is doing.
Even when he's sad, you know, you great faith that he will get happy again.
Uh-huh.
And then, oh, let's see, there's a couple or three that I would like to go see before they go into videos.
I guess, I can wait another month
and they will be videos.
Yeah
One is SILENCE OF THE LAMBS.
I've heard a lot about that one.
They say if you really want to be, uh, you really want some suspense, that's the one to see.
And, I understand that's a sequel to an earlier movie that showed about two weeks ago on television. Uh.
Well, you know, I think I read about that too.
Uh-huh.
And then THELMA AND LOUISE,
I think it's time we had a lady abuse the guys movie.
It's about time for one of those.
I want to go see that.
Yeah.
And I'm going to try to get in DANCES WITH WOLVES.
Oh, you haven't,
I've heard that is wonderful.
Uh-huh,
I've heard it's wonderful too,
but I, it's just that they are both very long uh, movies,
Yeah.
and the matinee starts before I can get away from work.
Oh.
And, after, after that I get involved in other things and don't want to don't want to go back.
Yeah.
Yeah,
I've heard that's,
we, uh, we, uh, rented the other one,
I was trying to think of the other one that we had rented lately, uh, was PRESUMED INNOCENT, with, uh, Harrison Ford,
I guess he's in there.
Uh-huh.
And, I thought that was really good.
You know, I saw that
and I really I cannot remember too much about it.
It was the one where he was a defense,
uh, not defense,
he was a
Uh-huh.
And there was a murder of one of the women that was in the, the D A office.
Uh-huh.
And then he ended up being accused of it.
Oh, that's right,
I remember now.
Yeah,
I remember.
Yeah,
so, I mean it really kind of had a turn at the end, when you found out who it was
Uh-huh.
Well, I've had a hard time enjoying Harrison Ford in anything since the Indiana Jones movies.
I think he ought to stay Indiana Jones.
I realize that he would like his career to develop,
but I don't want to see him in other things.
But, uh, I tell you, Sean Connery in the HUNT FOR RED OCTOBER,
I, I never did care for him as, in the James Bond movies.
I don't know
he was too .
I was never into those movies, either.
Yeah,
I didn't care for the type of movie,
but he was always slick, and greasy, and seemed to be conceited and had more women than he needed
and I didn't like him.
But, he has really developed into a marvelous character actor as he has come older.
Yeah,
I thought he looked real good with a beard, too.
Oh, yeah,
yeah,
he does
and there is just a, there's a,
I don't know, uh,
I think that beard gives him a look that he is always grinning, whether he is or not.
Yeah.
And he, he has that merry look about his eyes that looks like he stays in mischief all time.
And, I enjoy those,
and I enjoy some of the Michael J. Fox movies.
I didn't care too much for the last one either.
It just was not enough to it.
What was the last one?
I'm trying to think.
Uh.
Uh, the last,
like, BACK TO THE FUTURE then was the last one .
No,
no,
no,
it was called, uh, HARD WAY, where he was an actor, trying to portray trying to portray, portray a policeman.
Oh, okay,
And that,
