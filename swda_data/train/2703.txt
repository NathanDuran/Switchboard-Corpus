B|Well, that didn't go over,  now.|sd
A|Oh, it it didn't,  go through.|bf
B|They, they,  they decided, you know, George Bush, who, who's the main owner of the Rangers, decided that, uh, they'd stay in Arlington.|sd

A|Oh, okay.|bk
B|So we're going to, they're going to stay there. Which is fine, because Arlington's got a lot of things to offer.|sd
B|And, and that was their main, main money making, you know,  deal for the city.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And it would have devastated them if they would have taken it away.|sd

B|all the tourists come there.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b

A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And it's takes us maybe, uh, well, thirty-five to forty minutes to get there from Plano, which is not too bad at all.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
A|That's about what it takes me to get to Memorial.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|Um,  it's it actually funny that, um, I live just outside of Baltimore.|sd
B|So,|%
A|And it takes me almost the same amount of time to go to Frederick, but as it does to go to the, the ballpark in in, uh, Baltimore. Because, um, to go out to Frederick, I just jump on the Interstate|sd
