A|Yeah,|aa
A|uh-huh|aa
B|Hello.|fp
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|Oh, I'm sorry|fa
B|I must have got the other line cut off.|sd
B|Uh, so, they've been doing that it for a while now|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and, uh, it,|%
B|I live in an apartment|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and my facilities ,|%
B|there it is,|sd
B|hold on on|ad
A|Uh-huh|aa

A|Yeah,|b
A|okay,|bd
A|you're okay,|bd
B|Yeah.|b
A|okay|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
B|Uh, anyhow, they have facilities here in my apartment complex for recycling paper only.|sd
B|Uh, I've been recycling for maybe about two years now and, at another public facility where they have, you know, recycling of glass, uh, aluminum and paper.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|Now,|%
A|Have you, have you cycled, recycled plastic also?|qy
B|No,|nn
B|and that's what I, I don't understand exactly why they don't have that option.|sd
A|We, we have out here uh, up until just this last year in on you are town there wasn't any really good way,|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|they had some bends, *sp: bins  around that we could find and put them in|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|but not all that many,|sd
A|it wasn't very well advertised|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|but recently, uh, the refuse department has, has, uh, is working on getting a system going where we will actually have, uh, a bend that we put things in for recycling these other things|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|so it, it should be good, uh,|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|I think it's a marvelous idea when you think of, uh, when I just think of the papers that I dump out|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|I mean there just,|%
A|it's such a|%
A|I waste,|%
A|I just hate to think about it.|sd
B|Yeah,|b
B|now an additional thing is, uh,|%
B|where I work they also have recycling there of, uh, all white paper and of, you know, cans also|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|so, I mean, a lot of people, you know, right at the vending machines,  they have receptacles that, you know,  you can just pop your cans in|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and near the,  Xerox machines they have places, you know, for your,  paper,|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|you know, I keep a little box at my desk, you know,|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and I just throw, as I'm using the white paper, you know, I just throw it right in there,|sd
A|Uh.|b
B|and then, you know, they have someone that comes around and pick it up, you know, every afternoon which, you know, is an excellent idea,  at work because I know the amount paper they go through there|sd
A|Yeah,|b
A|that's neat.|ba
A|Yeah.|b
B|because,|%
A|Yeah,|aa
A|that's right.|aa
A|I guess one of the things, I think, that needs to happen is we need to be better informed about,  about it,|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|there's needs to be more public, uh,  service of, programs or something that would let us know had a happens to it and helps us to become enthused about it because of what is happening|sv
B|Yeah,|aa
B|I would agree with that.|aa
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and there's,|%
B|Right.|b
A|I've seen a few things but not very much,  really|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and I, I think that's a shame|sv
A|they need to, uh, do a little more,|sv
A|I'd like to know, for instance, when I, when they say, uh, plastic, all plastic, what kind of plastic,  can you put all together or,  is there some reason not to,|sv
B|Exactly.|aa
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|uh, now maybe they just sort it after they get it and throw out what they can't use,|sd
A|I don't know|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|but I, I'd be glad to organize it,  if that they'd tell me what it is I'm doing|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Right.|b
B|Uh-huh,|b
B|yeah,|aa
B|I agree with you there,|aa
B|another thing that I like here which is,|%
B|I do with,|%
B|I have to actually go to two different recycling areas because one of them is that, uh,|sd
B|their aluminum cans is for, uh, Children's Hospital, for a burn fund|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|so all the monies are donated, you know,  for the recycling to Children's Hospital, which I think is an excellent idea,  there, you know, because the other,  public,|sd
A|Yeah.|b
A|Uh-huh,|b
A|that's great.|ba
A|Now that gives,  you a little bit of incentive there.|sv
B|Right,|aa
B|right,|aa
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and before even at work,|%
B|before they started the recycling plan, which at work they've only been doing since January first of this year, I had had everyone in my department recycling|sd
B|and, you know, I would have them drop,  right, drop their cans off in my office|sd
A|Saving them for you, uh.|bf
B|and then I would haul them, you know, here to this place for the Children's Hospital Fund which got people really going into it,|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|I think that's,  right.|ba
B|but,|%
A|I think, I think helping us be more enthusiastic about it,  helping us maybe, maybe using the money for something special that would be like paying off the national debt|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Uh-huh|b
B|That,|%
B|there you go.|aa
B|That's for sure.|aa
A|But I, I think that's|%
A|right I think they, there needs to be a little bit more in the area of, of, uh, advertisement,  and letting, public letting you understand,  more of what it is you're doing, why you're doing it, how you're it's done and,  what, what happens to it because I think that's, that would help a lot.|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Right,|aa
B|right.|aa
B|Uh-huh,|b
B|and I'm sure, you know, in the near future I would think they would be coming out with more,|sv
A|Yeah.|b
B|you know, I've seen a definite trend, you know, towards more recycling,  everywhere, you know, even at McDonald's,  you know, with their, their use of no,  foam containers anymore.|sd
A|Yeah,|b
A|I,|%
A|Yeah.|b
A|Yes,|b
A|I, I'm glad,  to see some of these things, I think.|sd
B|Right.|b
B|I think, I think it is getting more, you know, advertisement.|sv
A|People are becoming more conscience all the time that it's necessary to do,  and that we need to somehow get away from the fact that we have to have everything individually wrapped,|sv
B|Right.|b
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and all these things that,|%
B|Right.|b
A|I think that's true.|aa
A|Well, I think,|%
A|I'm that's about my, uh  some on recycling|sd
B|Yeah|b
A|but I, I enjoyed talking to you.|fc
