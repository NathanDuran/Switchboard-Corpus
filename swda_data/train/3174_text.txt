Uh, I work at T I
and we have, uh, of course, started drug testing, uh, random drug testing here
and, uh, I haven't gotten called yet,
but, uh, I feel that it's probably it's pretty good if, if they feel like there is a vast majority of the people at the company doing drugs.
Do they feel that way?
Uh, I think that they thought that there was a lot of drug usage here at T I,
but I think our latest statistic said something like ninety-nine point nine eight percent were, uh, testing negative on all the on, on all the testing.
Uh-huh.
Well, I, I think it's a good idea just because I'm opposed to to the drugs.
Uh-huh.
I think it can cause a lot of problems even though they think they can handle it.
Uh-huh.
It's, uh,
I don't know,
I don't really liken it to alcohol
but, yet that can be carried to an extreme, too.
Uh-huh.
So I think it's a good idea
and I think just the idea that you know that you may be tested might keep you off of them or get you off of them because you're,
Right.
I don't know that their job would be at risk,
because I think they may put them into some sort of a program to get them off of drugs.
Right.
I would think that,
is that how they do it at T I maybe.
That,
Right,
I
at T I, if you get called in and you test positive for drugs, then you're put on a program
and, uh, you know, you go through the program
and then you're called like six months after you complete the program
Uh-huh.
and if you test positive, then you're terminated.
Well, I guess I, I draw a hard line
but, you know, I would, I'm, I'm in favor of, of that type of thing.  That,  uh, you, you have people out there that are responsible for certain things
Yeah,
uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
and you expect them to do their job
and it, it is possible that, you know, that they can't do as good a job, uh, as they might do.
That's right.
Uh-huh.
Oh, and, of course they can also cause injury to other people.
Uh-huh.
If they're, if they're not, uh, you know, fully functional mentally while they're doing their job. They could cause  you know, serious injury to   another people.
Right,
and you never know
they could just go off the deep end   on, on a, on something  uh, that whatever  they're  taking at the time
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
and, and it would be, uh, you know, out of the question.
Uh-huh.
Also, I guess you can, you know, get the wrong kind of stuff and kill yourself just by having a wrong mix of or watered down or or whatever, all kinds.
That's right.
Oh yeah.
I sub in the schools
Uh-huh.
so I've, you know, had a,
they they talk a lot about  drugs  there
So,
Right.
and I think it's good that they're trying to start some programs down in the elementary schools.
Right.
But, you know, I think they can test all they want for drugs you know,
and if they need to do that as a condition for employment
Uh-huh.
and I know many of them are doing it.
I know my son has had to do it for both Sam's and Wal-Mart
Uh-huh.
and I don't know how many others are doing that
and, and I think  that's good  because so many of the kids that are on them are sort of bums that they need to get their life straightened up at  an early age
Oh, yes.
Uh-huh.
That's right.
and, uh, I don't know,
it's just a problem that no one is sure just how to handle I think.
Uh-huh.
You know, I think personally I'm for it.
There's several reason why I, I could think of right now why we shouldn't have it such as drug testing,
they say, runs approximately a thousand dollars a person every time you do it.
Really?
And,
It's that high?
Yes.
And, oh, yeah,
it's very expensive.
Oh.
And, uh,
I didn't realize it was that expensive.
Uh-huh.
It's not like a normal urinalysis
Uh-huh.
it's very expensive to run them.
And, uh, I didn't get a raise this year,
because, nobody in our company got a raise.
Uh-huh.
But, yet  they spend all the money  on drug testing
Just lucky to have jobs.
and if they weren't spending all the money on drug testing, people could have got a raise.
So, see, there, you know, there's different,
I don't think that that's, that, I think that's more of a personal view of mine other than a, a yes, sir, we should have drug testing because there's really a problem
Uh-huh.
and I know that.
But then, I have other views to it.
I just, I didn't think it was that expensive because my son was in probably a week and a half period
Uh-huh.
and Sam's and Wal-Mart are, are owned by the same people
Uh-huh.
he took one for, for, uh, Wal-Mart for job hiring
Uh-huh.
and then Sam's called him
and, and he took another one
Right.
and I, you know, I don't know why they both made him do that since it was so close together.
Uh-huh.
I can see if
because, you know, if it's a thousand dollars, that's a thousand dollars they wasted.
Theirs might not run a thousand dollars. *Their's Theirs
Our,
from what I understanding here at T I, they run close to a thousand dollars an employee.
Well, maybe they run,
I don't know, you know,
that's just guessing it.
Maybe they run a lot of other tests,
or maybe it's under a health type program that it it, it would catch a lot of things.
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
I, I just can't imagine  them screening all these employees,  paying a thousand dollars to get them.
But, no
for all the, the
Oh, it's,
