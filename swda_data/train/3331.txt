A|Well, what I believe is one of the major uh, things that is wrong with our public school system is that, um, we do not have enough discipline|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and the parents do not let the teachers discipline the children the way that they need to be disciplined right now.|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Uh-huh.|aa
B|I agree with that.|aa
A|Uh, when I went to school, I know I was scared to death about being disciplined,|sd
B|You were?|bh
A|and the discipline that my daughter receives now in going to school is just totally different.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|You know, you just, you did not see, I did not see anybody in my classrooms, when I was going to school, act up the way that kids do these days in the classroom.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
B|Yeah,|aa
B|yeah.|aa
B|From what I understand, they act up pretty bad|sv
A|Yeah,|aa
A|that's right,|aa
A|that's right.|aa
B|What, uh, grade is your daughter in?|qw
A|My, my daughter's in the, um, fourth grade|sd
B|Uh-huh,|b
B|uh-huh.|b
A|and, um, there's children in her classroom that just totally disrupt the classroom, where the teacher cannot teach|sd
B|Uh-huh,|b
B|uh-huh.|b
B|Yeah.|b
A|and when I went to school that just wasn't put up with.|sd
B|Oh, no,|aa
B|uh-huh.|aa
B|They always had a paddle in our school.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Well, they, they just don't do that any more.|sv
B|I know.|aa
A|But the school system's afraid of getting sued and, um, all sorts of lawsuits I'm sure because of things like that.|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Yeah,|aa
B|yeah.|aa
A|And, I also believe we don't, even though I feel like I pay a good share towards the school system, that the teachers are still underpaid|sv
A|and we still don't have enough money towards put in toward public school.|sv
B|Uh-huh,|aa
B|uh-huh.|aa
B|Uh-huh.|aa
A|And, um, I think that if we had enough money and paid the teachers a little bit more, that maybe that could solve some of our problems.|sv
B|Yeah.|aa
B|Wasn't that what part of the lottery is going to go for, if we approve it?|qy
A|Yes|ny
A|supposedly that's what it's suppose to go for,|sd
A|and you know, we'll just have to wait and see whether that's approved or not.|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|You know, I don't know your feelings toward that.|qw^d
A|I guess we shouldn't get into that|ad
A|but, um, and what else, um,|^h
A|I think in some ways that they need to be more careful of the teachers that they hire.|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|I have heard stories, uh, from other parents that I know of, their children are in high school that teachers are out there giving drugs and selling drugs,|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|No.|ar
B|Really?|bh
A|Oh, yeah,|ny
B|Ooh.|bk
A|I've, I've heard some horrible, horrible stories about high, high school teachers|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and, you know, to be, be more careful of the teachers that we place in our school.|sd
B|Uh-huh. Um.|b
A|Um, that's basically about all that I know that may be wrong with the school system.|sd
A|I think, with what they have to work with, I think they're doing a pretty good job right now.|sv
B|Oh, I do too,|aa
B|I think they're doing real good job.|aa
A|Uh-huh,|b
A|so.|%
B|But, then, what do I know,|qh
B|I don't have any kids.|ng
B|No,|nn
B|none at all|sd
A|Yeah,|bk
A|okay,|bk
A|so this is probably a real hard subject for you.|qy^d
B|Oh, yeah|ny
A|Yeah.|bk
A|Okay,|bk
A|well, I guess, um, we can discontinue our call now.|fc
