B|Oh so ,|%
A|Okay.|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
A|I'm not as ashamed to claim them this year as I have been so|sd
B|Well, it,|%
B|let's put it this way.|^h
B|We've got the New England Patriots up here|sd
B|so.|%
A|Oh yeah.|b
A|Right. Well,|%
B|They've had some serious problems in the past couple of years.|sv
A|Really?|bh
B|Yeah.|ny
A|Why?|qw
B|Um, well, uh, partly due to ownership.|sd
B|You know, uh, Victor Kiam owned the, uh, the Patriots uh, for a period of a number of years|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and he always had this, uh, this wonderful quality of being able to put his foot in his mouth every time he went to say something|sd
B|and, uh, they've had some financial problems with the team and so forth.|sd
B|And it recently was sold to, uh, some other people|sd
B|so, hopefully, this ownership can set up new direction and, uh, keep, uh, the Patriots in the New England area anyways|sd
A|Yeah.|b
A|Well it will be fun for you to watch up there anyway  to see what happens now you,|sv
B|Oh, yeah.|b
B|I've been to a couple, I've been to a few games before.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|Now you, you're, you're from Texas.|sd
A|Right.|aa
B|So you've got two football teams down there.|sd
A|Well, it depends on where you're from in Texas.|arp_nd
A|I live right by Dallas so we have one football team  as far as we're concerned|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Oh, I see.|bk
A|That's how it is.|b
B|There's that type of segregation, huh?|qy
A|It's divided,|sd
A|yeah.|ny
B|Wow!|ba
A|It really is,|aa
A|so we've got our Cowboys here|sd
A|and and, uh, I don't think anybody roots differently|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|but  I have a boyfriend that lives in Fresno|sd
B|Do you,|%
A|and he is for the L, the, uh, Raiders. L A Raiders,|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|so.|%
B|Do you follow professional sports at all?|qy
A|Well, I just started to this year because of these silly Raiders that didn't do very well|na
A|but I've been trying more this year.|sd
A|I think I know a little more than I use to.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|I never knew very much at all|sd
A|so I'm trying|sd
B|Well, it's a good past time, you know.|sv
A|Yeah.|b
B|Particularly football.|sv
B|They say, uh, football attracts more men because of the, you know, the, you see the, the physical aggression on the field|sv
B|and supposedly, psychologists say that, uh, that, uh, men take out their frustrations by watching football|sv
B|and, you know, they get together with a bunch of guys|sv
B|and they, uh, uh, and they have a good time and everything|sv
B|and that's suppose to be some of the, uh, the male bonding and the, and the, uh, the male instincts, I guess, or something about the, uh,|sv
A|So I shouldn't even try to do it, huh|qy
B|Well, no.|nn
B|It, it's good as, in terms of, in terms of, uh, of a contest.|sv
A|Yes.|b
B|I think that, uh,|sv
B|I personally like hockey better because it has contact, it's a contact sport.|sd
B|It has the speed.|sv
A|Right.|b
B|And the hand eye coordination|sv
B|and it takes a certain skill to play hockey.|sv
B|Not everybody can play hockey.|sv
A|Yeah.|b
B|So we,|%
B|and|%
B|that's,|%
B|we're a big hockey area up here,|sd
B|I bet up here in New England as well as, you know, in, in the Minnesota area|sv
A|Really .|b
B|but,|%
A|I don't even think we have that in Texas.|sv
B|What, hockey?|br
A|We might.|sd
A|Do we?|qy
A|I mean, no|ar
A|you probably know,|sv
A|I don't know.|sd
B|No,|nn
B|there's no hockey,|sd
B|there's no|sd
A|Nobody talks about it|sd
A|so I don't think we do.|sv
B|There's no professional hockey teams in, in Texas|sd
A|No,|b
A|uh-huh.|b
A|And we have a soccer team that comes and goes.|sd
A|We don't even have that very much,|sd
A|so.|%
B|Yeah.|b
B|I think though that professional football in particular, is becoming so diluted now.|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|Like they have this World Football League.|sd
B|You see, we have the N F L that, that Dallas and Houston are in and New England Patriots and L A Raiders and those teams|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|There are those teams that play in professional, National Football League|sd
B|but, uh, now they have what's called the World Football League|sd
B|and they have all these teams from,|sd
B|there's a team in London|sd
B|and there's a team  there, there's, uh, teams, other European teams|sd
A|Oh.|b
B|and there's teams in the United States|sd
B|and they're playing now during the summer months|sd
B|and it's really you know, overkill|sv
A|Oh yeah.|b
B|And there's only so much football you can watch.|sv
A|Yeah.|b
A|Well, I like to do,|sd
A|I don't like to watch.|sd
B|Yeah,|b
B|that's good.|sv
A|I don't like to watch anything.|sd
A|So it kind of annoys me when people just lay in front of a T V and watch all this stuff.|sd
A|I think it's an,  excuse to do nothing|sv
A|and I, I can see what you're saying about the male bonding|sv
A|and the  guys get together|sv
B|Yeah.|b
A|and that's kind of cool.|sv
A|That's fun, you know.|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|But it can get really overdone.|sv
B|Now, have you ever been to a professional football game?|qy
A|Yeah,|ny
A|I have.|sd
B|Have you?|qy
A|Yeah,|ny
A|yeah,|ny
A|I have.|sd

B|You, the,|%
B|well the same thing.|sv
A|Yeah.|b
B|We, we talked our wives,|%
B|there's about six or eight guys that we use to go out for these games.|sd
B|And, uh, we talked our wives into going with us one time|sd
B|and they had a real good time|sd
B|and it was, basically, for the social atmosphere.|sd
A|Right.|b
A|And that's the thing, you know.|sv
B|You go, you know three or four hours before the game.|sd
B|You go set up.|sd
B|We set a table up,|sd
B|we do some cooking, some barbecueing, have a few drinks and then go in and see the game and see the Patriots lose and then go home and eat, drink some more.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|But, but that whole,|%
B|it, it's not so much, sure the contest itself and the game itself,|sv
A|Yeah.|b
B|that you miss sitting home in your parlor, you know, uh, with, with a six pack of beer and some, uh, potato chips, you know|sv
A|That's right.|aa
B|you, you miss that.|sv
A|Yeah,|aa
A|that's right.|aa
B|And, and any professional sport I think, you miss that.|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|The atmosphere of being there, you know.|sv
A|Yeah.|b
A|Well, in high school I went to every football game|sd
A|and, well, I twirled, you know.|sd
B|Yep.|b
