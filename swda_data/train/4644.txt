A|Well, uh, preferred benefits, uh,|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
A|I worked for a large corporation in the past|sd
A|and I think large corporations can give better benefits than small corporations because, right now I'm working for a very small corporation where the owner is right there|sv
A|and, uh, there is a lot of profit that's coming in|sd
A|but when it comes to, uh, small corporations they seem to pocket it a little bit quick, quickly, or whatever, or however you want to say it|sv
A|and, uh, the benefits aren't as great when I worked for a big corporation because the big corporations seem to look at its employees and say okay|sv
A|we've got this amount of money,|^q
A|let's put into this plan, this plan,|^q
A|you got Four Oh One K plans.|sv
A|You have, uh, better vacation plans, uh,|sv
A|you have, just in general, maternity leave plans that kind of thing.|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|Big corporations are able to do that versus small corporations, uh, you know,|sv
A|they just don't have the money or just feel that there isn't the need for it.|sv
A|So, I've worked for both big and small|sd
A|so I've had a chance to kind of take a look at, uh, the pros and cons of both.|sd
B|Right.|b
B|Well I've worked for, uh, well I worked for H and R Block here in Massachusetts for awhile.|sd
A|Sure.|b
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And the only,|%
B|they even hate to give out unemployment at the end of tax season because they, you know, they're fairly, even though they're a large scale company, they're very, the offices, the individual offices are very small|sd
A|Sure.|b
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Huh.|b
A|Sure.|b
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and now I work for the Framingham school system because I'm a teacher.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Sure.|b
B|And, uh, we have much better benefits, you know, in the system.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|We have a good pension plan.|sd
B|Uh, let me see, we have a profit sharing plan to a degree.|sd
A|That's pretty good for, you know, being a, a school district type program.|sv
B|Right.|aa
B|And we have the eye glasses, the health care  and the whole kit and caboodle because what  they did is they threw all the town employees in together.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Wow.|ba
A|That's extremely good.|ba
B|Yeah.|b
B|Really.|b
A|there's no type of, uh, savings of any sort that the company will reimburse you for.|sd
A|There's really,|%
A|I think you're allowed so many times, uh, I think two or three days a a year.|sd
A|It's not accumulative, type of sick leave uh, you know, things like that.|sd
B|Oh!|b
A|So I've been looking at big corporations and saying, the big corporation that I've worked for in the past had the pension plans, had the big health, health care, uh,|sd
A|you had your insurance|sv
A|and you didn't have to pay in as much as if you go to a, a very small place.|sv
A|Uh, they don't have as good as insurance packages as big corporations.|sv
A|And|%
B|Right.|aa
B|The only trouble we've had here in Massachusetts is the town and state employees have run into problems, especially the retired ones.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|My father's retired from the town of Framingham|sd
A|Sure.|b
B|and he said that they haven't gotten a, a cost of living raise  in over   five years.|sd
A|No.|b
A|Yeah.|b
A|Yeah.|b
A|Yeah.|b
B|And he said that's the only thing that really stinks as far as being retired|sd
B|and  but I hear that bill is in the Senate right now|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and it's, hopefully  will go through.|sv
A|Sure,|aa
A|sure.|aa
A|Yeah,|aa
A|yeah.|aa
B|But, uh, you know, I think the schools are at, where the schools isn't just the school system and not just the teachers.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|They took in the whole town plus all you know,|sd
A|Is it a union?|qy
B|Uh, we have the teachers union which helps out a lot,|na
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|but the town of Framingham pays the benefits|sd
B|and that's all the town workers, water and sewer|sd
A|Oh, that's pretty good.|ba
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and where it's a very large town,|sd
B|it's actually, should be a city|sd
B|but they kept it a town.|sd
A|Sure.|b
B|Uh, where it's extremely large, they were able to offer a little bit more which was  really great because we don't have to pay a mayor|sd
A|Yeah.|b
A|Uh-huh,|b
A|yeah.|b
A|Yeah,|b
A|I know what you mean|ba
A|and that's true.|aa
A|I mean, it does end up being quite a bit when you have to hire somebody for that position, sure.|sv
A|Yeah.|%
B|Right,|aa
B|because of most of our, you know, the town employees, as far as, uh, electoral positions, are part-time.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|So it works out good because we  reap the benefits of it|sd
A|Sure.|b
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and, uh, but as far as shopping for a job, I'd rather shop for the benefits than the salary.|sd
A|Well, that's it, you know,|ba
A|and, and I've kind of looked around, uh, at that, uh, too.|sd
A|Because, uh, salary wise I don't think I'm making as much with a big corporation because I think when you look at big corps or large,|sv
A|I'm talking like hugh companies like Three M, uh, I'm, uh, Honeywell, uh, Texas Instruments|sv
B|Right|b
A|I know people that are, that have vacation times, and benefits that I wouldn't even dream of in a small corporation.|sd
A|You bring it up to the owner|sv
A|and it's like come on, you know.|sv
A|Partly it's because the owner wants to keep getting richer and richer.|sv
B|Right|b
A|And, and, of course, when it's a small corporation, it also wants to expand|sv
A|so that money is spent|sv
