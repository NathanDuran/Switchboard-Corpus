B|and, and inevitably as soon as they're asleep, someone calls on the phone trying to sell me something.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And I think that, that is probably the most aggravating|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|Uh, you know, it invades my time.|sv
B|I'm the one that pays for the phone.|sd
B|Uh, if I want to buy something, I'll take the initiative and, and go find it, you know.|sd
B|And that just really does aggravate me.|sv
B|Uh, what do you think?|qo
A|Well, I mean I,|%
A|that's exactly the kind of thing I would have said.|sd
A|Although in my case it's my wife and I both work,|sd

A|and it's one solicitation call after another|sd
A|and, you know.|%
B|Your time is, is  valuable,|sv
A|Yeah,|aa

B|I just get aggravated about it.|sd
B|And,|%
A|Would, would you,|%
A|I mean if you could legislate something, what would you legislate?|qw
B|I really don't know.|sd

B|but I I don't know.|h
B|I just, I do particularly find it annoying.|sd
B|Uh, I'm really not sure. to be,|h
A|Yeah.|b
A|It, it seems, it seems to me that we should have the ability to designate with the phone company that we don't want to receive calls like that. *sv|sv
B|Well, that, yeah, that might,|%
A|And the people making these calls would be obliged to compare the, their lists that they're going to call against this list of people who don't want to be called.|sv
B|Identify themselves, yeah.|^2
B|Right.|aa
B|Well, that would be a good an interesting way,|sv
A|Uh,|%
B|yeah.|aa
A|And, that, that way, those who want it can have it|sv
A|and those who don't want it, don't have to have it.|sv
B|Right.|b

A|and,|%
B|And they just get everybody.|sd
A|Right.|b
B|Oh, boy.|ba
B|Well, I, I do wish that it would stop on my end because it, it seems to happen at the worst possible moments.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|And I, I guess the next one is, is door-to-door solicitors.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|I don't mind the children when they're selling things for school.|sd
B|I have kids|sd
B|and, you know, that's just kind of part of it|sv
A|Yeah|b
B|but when it's adults selling a variety of things and especially when men arrive at about ten o'clock in the morning uh, that really, it makes you not feel particularly safe|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Yes.|b
B|and, it's annoying as well.|sv
A|And these, and these people may in fact be just looking to find an unoccupied house to rob.|sv
B|Right,|aa
B|you just, you really don't know,|sv
B|so I, I find myself being a a bit abrupt and a little bit ruder than than I might normally be|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|but, I do feel like it's a, an invasion of my space.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|And, uh,|%
B|I've never quite understood the purpose of that.|sd

A|Yeah|b

B|Uh, generally someone's trying to sell me something|sd
B|or,|%
A|Right,|b
A|well, and sometimes that's, this is just the lead in to a sales pitch too.|sd
B|Right,|aa
B|right.|aa
A|Other times it's, you know, wasting your time to collect the data they want for their marketing purpose.|sv
B|Right.|aa
A|For which, if they would just pay me enough money I would be willing to consider.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
B|That's right.|aa
A|But, but a dollar isn't it,|sv

B|That,|%
B|yeah,|%
B|I, I,|%
A|and it,|%
B|Asking for information is, is,|%
