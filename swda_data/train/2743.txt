A|Okay.|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
A|Hi Norma.|fp
B|Hi.|fp
A|Have you taken anything back lately, uh, that you've bought?|qy
B|Well the only thing we've taken back recently are plants.  Shrubbery, that were guaranteed|sd
A|Well why?|qw
B|and we had no problem with it.|sd
A|Very good.|ba
B|We got our got our money back.|sd
A|Good.|ba
A|Well do you think that, uh, consumer goods, goods are generally getting better, or worse in quality?|qy
B|Well, I believe they're better.|sd
A|I do too.|aa
A|I believe about ten years ago that we went through a terrible time,|sv
A|but I don't,|%
A|I, I believe that they're better now,|sd
A|you know,|%
B|I think so.|sv
B|I don't think they're shoddy, not as shoddy.|sv
B|Electrical appliances I think are pretty good, reliable.|sv
A|however, I didn't like it very well when the transmission went out on my car with sixty-three thousand miles on it.|sv
B|Right|b
A|And I don't like it very well if, when my electric blanket that was only one year old went out at, uh, on one side.|sv
B|Oh, did you return it?|qy
A|No,|nn
A|I had moved away.|sd
B|No,|b^m
B|uh-huh.|b
A|I had taken the first one back.|sd
A|I didn't think that it heated well enough.|sd
A|It never did get anything but just moderately warm,|sd
A|took it back|sd
A|and, uh, the people told me well that's the way it's supposed to be|sd
A|and I fell for it|sd
A|and, uh, when I got this one it did, a it heated a little bit warmer|sd
A|and then after one year it started heating only on one side.|sd
B|Huh,|b
B|so either you or your husband can be warm but not both|bf
A|Also, I took an iron back after having it only one year.|sd
B|Oh.|b
A|Now I figure uh, anybody that is dumb enough to iron, needs to have an iron that will last a long time,|sv
A|and one year of ironing only once a week is not long enough for it to last.|sv
B|No,|aa
B|huh-uh.|b
B|Did they replace it?|qy
A|Well without even any question,|sd
A|but I think it was the store.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|Wal-Mart.|sd
B|Wal-Mart,|b^m
B|I was going to say, it must have been Wal-Mart.|sd
A|Yes|aa
A|And, uh, well, have you been buying any clothes lately? Any new clothes?|qy
B|I haven't bought any new|ng
B|well the last thing I bought was a dress last Summer.|sd
B|And the buttons turned on it over the winter.|sd
B|The buttons tarnished slightly|sd
B|and I have not gone back about it.|sd
A|That was poor quality, I think.|sv
B|I think it is too,|sv
B|and it was an expensive dress.|sd
A|I wondered if it weren't expensive,|sv
B|Yes|aa
B|it was.|sd
A|and they should have put buttons on it that would last forever.|sv
B|That's right,|aa
B|that's what I think too.|sv
B|And one belt loop, the uh, you know, like the chain link, chain belt loop half of it raveled out.|sd
A|Yes.|b
B|And that was, I believe a Leslie Faye dress|sd
B|and it was, I think, over a hundred dollars.|sd
A|You spent that much on your dresses?|qy
B|Yeah,|ny
B|I don't usually,|sd
B|but I did that one.|sd
A|You're really divulging very personal information.|sv
B|But I think it should have been better than that, for that money, is what I mean.|sv
A|Oh, of course, I do too.|sv
A|Well I believe that we've been talking about five minutes.|sv
B|Okay,|b
B|I think so.|sv
A|And Norma, it is just wonderful to talk to you.|fc
B|Good talking to you too,|fc
B|I've enjoyed it|fc
A|You are a good one to talk about consumer goods, because you keep up on it all the time.|fc
B|Well, we'll be talking to you later.|fc
A|Bye, bye.|fc
B|Bye, bye.|fc
