So how many, um, credit cards do you have?
Um, I think I'm down to one.
Oh, my gosh,
I wish I was that way.
Is that why you said I had more experience than you?
Well, no.
I was pulling your leg.
Oh.
Well, how, how do you use your credit card?
I mean, do you just keep it in reserve,
or.
I, I, well,
the way I'd like to try and use it is, um, you, you, you make your purchases at, at prime buying time
Uh-huh.
and then you pay that off and don't use it until, uh, it's paid off.
Uh-huh.
That's, that's my ideal way
Uh-huh.
How, how do you use it?
Emergencies come along,
and I and I use it.
Yeah
that's understandable, exactly.
Uh, like, uh, my car, uh, had a major problem, and seven hundred dollars,
Uh-huh.
and uh, things just come up
Right,
right.
and you just never get to use it the way you'd really like to.
Uh-huh,
uh-huh.
Well, actually I do have quite a few more credit cards than you have
Um, and I use them, you know,
like my American Express I use for, you know, gas, things like that,
and I pay that off monthly,
and then, um, some other credit cards, like store credit cards, you know, I do have them up there a little bit,
but, uh.
Uh-huh.
I try not to use them too often.
But living in this area, uh, like I live fifteen miles west of Washington, D C
Um.
it's a very expensive area
Yeah.
So, sometimes you have no other choice if you need to buy something.
Yeah.
Well, I, I know I was up in there and a lot of credit cards,
and I was just starting to get to where it was getting me in trouble
Right.
so we just disposed of them, paid them off, and got out of it.
Uh-huh.
I just.
Uh-huh,
well that was good that you had the opportunity to do that.
Yeah.
Uh-huh.
Now are you married, that you both, you and your wife use a credit card,
or?
Yeah,
yeah.
Uh-huh.
Well, now we pretty much just pay cash for as much as we can there.
Uh-huh. Um.
Uh-huh.
Our, our only credit card is Sears,
so and I have that for automotive purposes.
Uh-huh, um.
Right,
right.
Well, well that's great.
Um, everyone I know here uses, um, credit cards like they're going out of business to be honest with you.
Yeah.
Yeah,
it's, it's just too easy, basically, uh, just get yourself in trouble with those.
Yeah,
yeah.
Yeah,
the only other one I have,
I have like a Diner's Club through my, um, where I work
I see.
so that I use, because I travel some.
So I use that,
and I don't really have to worry about that, because I only use it for business,
so I automatically have the money to pay it off.
Yeah.
But. Um.
Uh, I wouldn't mind, uh, you know, getting back into one if they would, you know,
you start out at a low limit,
and then they just keep wanting you to increase your limit
Uh-huh.
and, and if I can get one that'll keep my limit at five hundred and I can never go over that or something like that, then that's fine,
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
but they
eventually gets up there to five thousand, ten thousand, whatever fifty thousand
Uh-huh.
Yeah.
forget it,
I don't want that.
Um, the temptation's too great.
Yeah.
Um.
So, I don't know,
just, uh,
writing checks is just as easy I guess.
Yeah,
that's true,
that's true,
but. So, I guess, uh, we've kind of exhausted this, uh, topic
Yeah,
well, really,
what, what can you.
Yeah,
you can't say too much about it really.
Other than, you use them or you don't use them.
You like them
or you don't like them.
So.
Uh-huh.
I guess, uh, they don't care if we end it early.
So, uh, hopefully, uh, you have a good Thanksgiving.
That's coming up,
and. And, then, uh, maybe we'll talk again.
Okay,
you, too.
Yeah,
may be,
you're the furthest person, actually, that I've talked.
I've talked to a lot of people in Texas.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Texas is the big one.
Yeah,
so.
Okay, then.
Well,  bye now.
okay,
bye-bye.
