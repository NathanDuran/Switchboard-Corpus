A|Okay.|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
A|So, uh, then, do you keep kids?|qy
A|Is this two year old yours|qy
A|or do you keep children for other people?|qrr
B|No.|nn
B|I have two children.|sd
B|I have a two year old and a three and a half year old.|sd
A|Oh, that's exactly what I have.|sd
B|Really?|bh
A|Yes.|ny
B|That's wild.|ba
A|I know.|ba
A|I,|%
A|my, my little girl was three and a half in March|sd
A|and my son was two in January.|sd
B|Oh, boy.|ba
B|Well, mine was two in March|sd
B|and the three and a half year old will be four in, in July.|sd
A|That's pretty close.|ba
B|So that is pretty close|ba
A|Yeah.|b
B|But I'm home with the kids all day|sd
B|and I have really, uh, tried to make that a priority even though it's financially a big strain on us.|sd
A|Yes,|aa
A|it is.|aa
B|But,|%
A|Have you been able to do that all along|qy
A|or,|%
B|Pretty much,|na
B|pretty much.|na
B|Uh, I work part-time|sd
B|but, uh, my husband's able, you know, mostly to take care of them when I'm working.|sd
B|So.  But, uh, we adopted these two little guys|sd
A|Yeah.|b
A|Oh, how neat.|ba
B|and that was another reason why I really wanted to be here because, you know, they have had a couple foster homes already.|sd
A|How old were they when you adopted?|qw
B|The baby was eleven weeks old|sd
B|and his brother was  twenty, twenty-two months.|sd
A|So he probably doesn't remember.|sv
A|Oh.|b
B|Yeah.|b
B|So.|%
A|Yeah,|aa
A|definitely needed.|aa
A|Well, that's, that's pretty interesting.|ba
A|Well, I have always wanted to be able to stay home with my kids you know.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|That was always my dream, you know.|sd
A|I wasn't necessarily a career person|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|but as long as I was single and had to work, I was going to get a good job and do the best I could.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|And my husband was in the type of business that, you know,|sd
A|it's insurance|sd
A|so you have to build a clientele|sd
A|and by the time we had kids I couldn't quit.|sd
B|Oh, boy.|ba
A|And so I haven't been able to quit yet.|sd
A|So I've had to deal a lot with child care|sd
A|and course, we're hoping within, hopefully, the next two years I'll be able to quit and stay home.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|But, uh, I started out, uh,|sd
A|my best friend kept my kids from the time my daughter was born  until she went to work last year in August|sd
B|Oh, that's neat.|ba
A|and it worked out pretty good.|sd
A|You know, we had always said from the beginning that if it gets in the way of the friendship then I'll take them somewhere else.|sd
A|You know, the friendship is more important.|sd
B|Yeah,|b
B|yeah.|b
A|And, uh, it was a wonderful experience for my kids because she really loved them, you know.|sd
A|She loved them like they were hers|sd
A|and I I knew, you know,|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|I had good peace of mind.|sd
A|I knew that they were taken care of|sd
A|and,|%
B|That's the hardest thing I think, you know  to, to deal with is that people love your, kids.|sv
A|Yeah.|b
B|I put, uh, my oldest in a preschool program just for him to have the experience of two mornings a week of being with other kids and starting to learn some taking turns and, you know  that kind of thing|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Yeah.|b
B|and, uh, he was in there for three months when I pulled him out|sd
B|and the, the teacher had eleven kids.|sd
B|It was excellent, supposedly.|sd
B|The reputation was fantastic for this place.|sd
B|Was supposed to be an excellent school|sd
B|and I had several friends who had, had recommended it, too.|sd
B|But it really gets down to the particular teacher.|sv
A|Huh.|b
B|And she was a new teacher at the school|sd
B|and she had eleven, you know, three year olds in a room|sd
B|and I just think it was way too much.|sv
B|The were almost all boys.|sd
A|But she had no help?|qy
B|Pardon?|br
A|She had no help?|qy
A|She was alone with them.|qy^d
B|I didn't think much.|na
B|I don't think much.|na
A|Oh, that is hard.|ba
B|Yeah.|b
B|And she was just my, uh,|sd
B|three year old is real active.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|And she just kept saying how wild he was.|sd
B|Well, you know, there was kind of a connotation there of him being, you know, it being a problem.|sd
B|Like he ran back from the bathroom singing and skipping she said.|sd
B|Well, you know, at three years old  I don't find that to be a behavioral problem  You know|sv
A|Jeez.|ba
A|I don't either|aa
A|So.|%
B|I mean, it's kind of like she was, there was so much going on that she felt like she needed to control more|sv
A|Yeah.|b
B|and it's really hard to|sd
B|you can't control eleven three year olds with one person, you know.|sv
A|You have to let them have some wild time  if that's considered wild|^2
B|Yeah, you know.|aa
B|So I just finally took him out. Plus financial reasons.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|It was expensive.|sd
B|But I was real careful and visited and everything ahead of time.|sd
B|But I still felt like even after all the checking I did, you know, you really can't know everything about what's going to happen.|sv
B|I felt safe that the kids weren't going to be left alone somewhere in a room where a teacher could do something inappropriate with them, you know, because there was enough classrooms close together that it was like a house with different classrooms.|sd
A|Right.|b
B|And I  felt like that was a big factor for me.|sd
A|Right.|b
B|That they would would be safe you know, from any kind of abuse or that  kind of thing.|sd
A|Yes.|b
A|Yeah.|b
A|Well, when, when my friend decided to go back to work, and whenever we had problems, it worked out okay because she would come and tell me|sd
A|and we'd work it out.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|After that, I found another girl that had gone to church with us that, you know, they needed it financially.|sd
A|She had a little boy that was the same age as my little boy|sd
A|and I though,|%
A|well, you know, we'll try her.|sd
A|But she came to our house|sd
A|and that just did not work.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|Uh, I mean, she loved the kids|sd
A|and she was good with them.|sd
A|But, uh, you know, they were filthy when I'd get home.|sd
A|Now I understand kids go out and play|sd
A|and they get dirty|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|but I mean filthy.|sd
A|I'm talking sand in the ears and the eyes and the hair|sd
A|and the|%
B|Oh, gosh.|ba
A|and I was, like, gosh.|sd
A|And then, you know, my own furniture and stuff was like, you know,|sd
A|the kitchen table, the, I'd find peanut butter and jelly all over the table and the chairs|sd
A|and the,|%
B|You had to come home and clean before you could  even do anything probably.|bf
A|and clean,|sd
A|and I was like,|sd
A|Yeah.|b
A|And then, in the end, uh, she basically ended up stealing a hundred dollars from me|sd
A|so I was, I had a pretty bad taste in my mouth.|sd
A|She told me about five thirty one afternoon, it was a Friday, that she wasn't keeping kids anymore as of Monday morning.|sd
B|Oh gosh.|ba
A|Well, you know, I work eight to five thirty|sd
A|so what am I supposed to do|qh
B|Yeah.|b
A|So I, well, I had been sick|sd
A|and I,|%
A|it ended up that I didn't go to work Monday because I was sick.|sd
A|So I stayed home with them|sd
A|and we went to some of the Kindercares.|sd
B|Oh, yeah.|b
B|I was, I took the kids there once just to try it.|sd
B|They had a free day at Kindercare.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|Yeah.|b
A|Well, that's what they said.|sd
A|There were two pretty near our house|sd
A|and they said, well, bring them in this week for a free day|sd
A|so I lined up someone Tuesday.|sd
A|They had a Mother's Day Out that my baby-sitter took them to, you know, which was fine.|sd
A|They liked it.|sd
A|They had been going to it for years.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And so I stayed with them Monday.|sd
A|Tuesday they went to that.|sd
A|Wednesday I took them to one Kindercare.|sd
A|Thursday I took them to another Kindercare|sd
A|and then Friday my husband and I split.|sd
A|But on Thursday I didn't like the Kindercares.|sd
B|I didn't either.|aa
B|I had  one bad, I had two bad experiences just that one day with medicine that my son was supposed to have for a cold that they never gave him.|sd
A|They,|%
A|They didn't give him.|b^m
B|And the other one was that the, the younger one got bit really badly by another child|sd
A|Oh.|b
A|Oh, that's horrible.|ba
A|And doing something with him.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|Well, not only was it going to cost me like a hundred and fifty dollars more a month, which I didn't have you know. I didn't, I, you know,|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|we're, we're a Christian family|sd
A|and, you know, they, because they're, you know, like public, they're not private you know. They can't pray,|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|they can't talk about God.|sd
A|They can't do anything like that|sd
A|and I don't want them indoctrinated  you know,|sd
B|So you feel like your values aren't getting,|bf
B|yeah,|b
B|yeah.|b
A|but I'd like them to be able to say, gee, God made the flowers, you know, and   things like that.|sd
B|Yeah,|b
B|yeah.|b
B|God loves you.|^q
A|Yeah.|b
B|You know, basic things like that.|sd
A|Yeah,|b
A|basic.|^2
B|Yeah.|aa
A|So, uh, I talked to another lady at church.|sd
A|It was like Thursday of that week|sd
A|and she said oh, I found the most wonderful place that I've been taking my daughter|sd
A|and I've know this girl,|^q
A|I went to college with her|^q
A|so I really, I, you, I, I value her opinion.|sd
A|And she told me about a private one.|sd
A|It, it was associated with one of the churches here.|sd
A|It's not the church I go to|sd
A|but it's, you know, it, it was Lubbock View Christian Church|sd
A|and it's a private academy.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And so I went over there|sd
A|and I talked to the lady.|sd
A|Well, they have like a three year waiting list.|sd
A|But she said, I had a mother tell me that she may take a job in San Antonio|sd
A|and she has a three year old and a toddler, which mine was at the time.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|And she said I should know something by tomorrow, which was Friday,|sd
A|and she said if she leaves, she said, I'll let you have her spot.|sd
B|Wow.|ba
A|And so Friday afternoon at five thirty, she called me|sd
A|and she said she's going.|sd
A|You can bring your kids Monday|^q
B|Oh, what luck.|ba
A|I know.|ba
A|I was just like, God set this, up for me.|sd

A|and|%
A|I love it.|sd
A|I have been at  such peace with myself.|sd
B|Oh, that's great.|ba
A|It's just been better than even when they were with my best friend because we don't have the little day to day hassles|sd
A|and the cost was not near as much as the Kindercares were going to be.|sd
B|Yeah|b
B|Oh, really?|bh
B|Wow.|ba
A|Did you hear my printer in the background.|qy
A|I'm sorry.|fa
A|I hope you can understand what I|sd
B|That's okay|bd
B|I got the dryer going in the background|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|so|%
A|I was only about twenty dollars more a month than I was paying because being a private institution they're nonprofit.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|So, they don't have to charge as much.|sd
B|Oh, that's great.|ba
A|And the hours are wonderful|sd
A|and I just, I think it's the best thing.|sd
A|I told Russ that we should have done this a long time ago you know|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|It's great.|ba
A|So I guess as long as I have to work, I feel good that they're there.|sd
A|they're getting the love, the care.|sd
A|They have a little curriculum.|sd
A|They teach them, you know, the alphabet, the numbers, the things which, you know, if they learn, they learn.|sd
A|If they don't, they don't.|sd
A|I don't feel like I have to indoctrinate them by age three|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|but it's kind of neat when they  come home with it, you know.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
B|They think it's fun.|bf
B|It's not a big, you know trauma to them to learn something.|bf
B|Yeah.|%
A|Oh, and the teachers.|sd
A|Well, Taylor got bit several times|sd
A|and Taylor bit several times|sd
A|and the teachers dealt with that.|sd
A|We're like, hey they're two|sd
A|and we keep them apart|^q
A|and we scold them|^q
A|and we correct them|^q
A|and, you know, they mark it all down|sd
A|and they let you know|sd
A|and, and, you know, they get over it real quick|sd
A|and he doesn't do it anymore|sd
A|and they work at the potty|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|I just, just|%
A|so mu,|%
A|I don't know.|h
A|I just feel like a big burden was lifted|sd
B|Really.|b
B|Because sometimes it is a burden having them all day because I can't  do anything with them here.|sd
A|It is.|aa
B|I can't even go grocery shopping right now  with the two of them because the baby is so into everything|sd
B|and the older brother is you know, running around all over the place|sd
B|so  it is, it's hard.|sd
A|and that's hard.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|Yeah|b
B|Yeah.|b
B|So.|%
A|Well, and it, it, you know,|%
A|but I|%
A|I, I, I wish you could find a good Mother's Day Out because that would be good for your  peace of mind also.|sd
B|Yeah,|b
B|I need to.|sd
B|Even for just a couple days a, mornings a week or something to have something like that,|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|so I, I think I'm going to look for that.|sd
B|Remind me of that now that you mention it|sd
A|Yeah.|b
A|Yeah.|b
B|and that's not that big a deal, you know.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|For a couple times|sd
A|And that's usually like, you know,|sd
A|I don't know when mine were going to Mother's Day Out,|sd
A|it was like from nine to three|sd
A|so that was a pretty good pretty good time, you know.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|My baby-sitter would take them and then pick them up.|sd
B|Yeah|b
A|So, that worked out real good.|b
