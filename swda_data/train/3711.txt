A|Well, uh, I have been to Canada several times|sd
A|but, uh, that is about it for me.|sd
A|I, I am from Denver|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and so, uh, growing up, uh, we would spend most of our vacations right there in Colorado.|sd
A|Uh, my family is, uh, uh, real into camping and four wheeling,|sd
A|and so, uh, several,|%
A|I, I, think, maybe, uh, four summers in a row, uh, we spent, uh, our vacation time in the summer, uh, four wheeling through, uh, portions of, uh, the southern half of Colorado|sd
A|and, and, uh, every time, uh, my mother had, uh, uh,|sd
A|I have two other sisters|sd
A|and my mother had us, uh, do some studying of the, the, area which we going to visit|sd
A|and then we had to write, uh reports, reports about it during, during our vacation. Which, which, was really fun.|sd
B|Oh no|ba
A|It was really fun.|sd
A|We, we, each got to write little books.|sd
A|Uh  and, uh, it had sparked an interest that, uh, of mine,|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|uh, my fiancee is a very very good photographer.|sd
A|That is what she had originally gone to school to do. Was photography|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and, uh, I, I, am close to receiving my English degree, uh, as, as, well as my, my, graduate degree,|sd
A|so, so, I, uh, uh, we have thought very seriously of trying to, uh, incorporate travel into and writing a book about, uh, some portion of travel, uh,|sd
A|so we are hoping soon, uh, not soon, maybe within the next ten years to get to, to take a trip over from, uh, over to Europe and take, uh, a trip from the northern portion of France uh, down to the southern tip of Spain, uh, and follow.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|It is kind of a backward S shape, uh, trail that the pilgrims use to take, uh, in, in, uh, back in the medieval times, uh, to see the relics, uh, in, uh, southern Spain and in Italy|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and so we would like to take pictures of the gothic and Romanesque monasteries and, uh, just take that journey all the way down and then right a book about it.|sd
B|Right.|b
B|That would be quite a project.|sd
A|Yeah,|aa
A|it would be|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|uh, it, it is our big dream.|sd
B|Well, it would be a lot fun.|sv
B|You know, there is good and there is bad|sv
B|and my experience in Italy was not my favorite for sure.|sd
B|But, Well, I flew into Milan.|sd
A|Oh, uh,|%
A|really?|bh
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|My daughter is, uh, a twirling champion|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and she had to perform over there and, in Turin|sd
B|and so we had to fly into Milan|sd
B|and we got on the subway after so much trouble because the Italians, even if they speak English, they do not want to let you know|sd
A|Oh, sure.|ba
B|and they gave us all the wrong directions|sd
A|Oh.|b
B|and there were just two of us.|sd
B|At the airport they put us on the wrong bus|sd
B|Finally, we saw a policeman.|sd
B|He put us on the subway.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|We sat there, uh,|sd
B|we did not know Italian.|sd
B|We looked at each other.|sd
B|We said things like spaghetti You know things like that.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|We finally followed some kids who told us where to get off.|sd
B|We followed these kids with, uh, gym bags|sd
B|and we figured that must be the sports arena|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and we lucked out|sd
B|and then when we needed to go to the bathroom there was nothing but a whole in the ground.|sd
B|I mean it was so, It was kind of a nightmare.|sd
A|Wow.|b
B|But, that was our experience|sd
B|and I guess all of Italy is not like that.|sv
A|Right.|b
B|But where we were, it certainly was|sd
B|and the hotel that we stayed in,|sd
B|we stayed with our English friends, their team in the hotel|sd
B|and it was beautiful.|sd
B|It was very modern.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|But it was very far away on a bus.|sd
A|Oh.|b
B|So, you know, it was, it was really, uh, it was interesting.|sd
