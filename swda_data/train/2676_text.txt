Do you live in Plano or work in Plano, or both?
Both.
Both,
are you a T I
Yes.
Are you at work right now?
Uh-huh.
So am I.
In building, which building?
Well, are you Summit or are you, uh,  Spring Creek?
I'm, I'm,  I'm Spring Creek.
Oh this is fun.
What building are you in?
I'm building, uh, one.
Oh, I'm building two.
At least we found something different
That's,
I've never had a call,
Not like that.
Neither have I.
No,
isn't that funny?
I usually get some place,
I got a woman in New Jersey the last time I called, I think.
Right.
That's funny.
That is funny.
So,
So how's the how's the weather in building two?
The weather in building two is cold
it's been cold.
It's been cold in the building.
Outside the building it's not bad.
Typical T I, or T I,
listen I got me doing it.
Typical Texas Spring.
Are you a native to Texas?
No,
no,
I'm, I'm a transplant.
From?
From California.
So what do you think of the Texas weather?
Not as nice as California
How long have you been here?
Oh, five years now.
Oh, okay.
I've been here long pretty long.
So.
You, you, you know about August then.
Yes,
oh, I've been through five of those
Okay,
there's no surprises left.
Right,
right.
A lot of people try to leave the state for a couple of weeks in August, for, you know,
if they're going to go out of state for vacation that's the time to go.
Uh-huh.
Good idea.
Real good idea.
Yeah,
we went up to Wyoming this last, uh, Summer during that time.
And it was like you know, eighty degrees up there.
It was beautiful.
Nice to get out of Texas for a while.
We went to Alaska.
Well, that's, that's the even, even farther away.
That is really nice.
It is so cool, you wear a jacket, you know.
Even in the Summer time, huh.
Yeah,
or keep one handy. Because it's, it rains a lot in Alaska.
Uh-huh,
uh-huh.
Is that right?
Uh, it,
they call it their liquid gold.
Um.
But it, you know,
you get sunshine,
and it's lovely,
and then it rains just enough to keep everything nice and moist and very green. And blooming.
Green.
Um.
Oh my goodness, it's pretty.
Right.
Well, Texas isn't bad.
No,
no.
Not in the Spring.
Right.
I have to think every year to try to remember what it was, what's it supposed to like this time of year.
Spring is nice.
Yeah.
Because March we usually get a lot of rain, in March, you know.
It'll seem the news, the Harold Taft, you know, on the local news.
Right.
March we typically get a lot of rain,
and we've had this many inches,
and, you know, we're right on target, you know,
and just seem like we were getting a lot of rain in March,
but I
Oh, we always we always do though.
it's hard to remember twelve months ago what it was like.
Yeah
uh, it,
I wish, I just wish it wouldn't come all at once
That's right,
and then we get all that heat.
Right.
Well, it's just that, you know,
when it rains, it rains.
In California you get these nice, lovely rains, you know, nothing really you know, like downpours like you have here.
The other day we had some hail, the biggest hail I've ever seen in Texas.
Oh, really.
Yeah,
I live in Garland.
Oh, you got into that bad stuff.
Yeah.
We got hail the size of marbles.
I mean, just so noisy hitting the house
and the glass on the windows.
It didn't break anything,
but we went out there afterwards
and there's ice balls the size of marbles all over our lawn.
Isn't that strange.
I know, I,
you pick them up, you know,
and they're perfectly round.
And I go, gee, how did they form, you know, so perfect like that.
I think that's one of the strange, strange things,
and you very seldom see it though.
Right,
right.
I've seen hail, you know,
but usually the size, you know, of, uh, tiny, tiny pebbles.
You know, really small, you know.
But this was, uh, really large.
So it had come, it's a drop of water that had come through quite a few rain clouds apparently.
Is that correct?
Uh, I don't know how hail is formed to tell you the truth.
I think, I think that's,
You don't think it's cold enough, you know to,
It's not on the ground,
but in the clouds it is.
Right,
must be.
I guess,
and then, I think, you know, all that falling would warm it up and melt it,
but maybe that's what rounds it, I don't know. But, tumbling.
I was dumb.
I was in, um, Florida for a week on business.
Uh-huh.
And I had called back to the house.
I stayed the weekend,
and I called back to the house.
My housekeeper was baby-sitting my cats and dogs, pitched said something to the effect of, now we've made the national news, don't get upset, and don't worry,
it's in Garland where all the bad weather is.
I said, Okay, you know
Uh-huh.
and I watched the news,
and I thought, ha ha, that's Garland, that's not Plano,
I don't have anything to worry about.
I was on the plane heading back to Dallas before it dawned on me, stupid, you own property in Garland
Felt so dumb.
Um.
Finally I got home and found out my property was okay.
Yeah.
There was no problem with it.
But I guess you just tend to think of, of where your house is you know, and nothing else.
Right.
Right,
and close to that, what's called Duck Creek that runs through part of Garland, that's the part that always seems to get hardest hit when there's, there's the hard rain.
Oh, oh, I see.
The creek overflows
and a lot of houses, a lot of houses around that creek seem to, to get flooded
Oh, okay.
the streets and stuff around that area,  get a lot of  flooding.
The house, that house,  that I bought is close to a Firewheel golf course.
Okay.
Just going to be blocks off of that new highway one ninety that's going through.
Right.
That's where I live, close to that.
Oh really.
Yeah,
uh, uh, not quite,
I don't live in that Firewheel division.
But I live close by there in north, far north Garland.
Is that a nice area?
Yeah
they're supposed to,
it's getting built up, you know, with more new, new shopping centers and things. You know,
it's a fairly new area.
Yeah
and, uh, and they're supposed to be building a mall somewhere close by, by the next, by ninety-three or ninety-four or something,
a brand new mall not too far away from that area,
Well,
so.
The house that the house that I bought was really, really nice.
It'd be nice.
Uh-huh,
in the Firewheel Estates there, whatever.
Yes,
yes.
Uh-huh.
Really, really nice home, very pretty. Uh.
Uh-huh.
But you're not living there right now.
No,
I'm going to lease it.
Oh, I see.
It's, it's investment property.
I see.
But it is really, it's a very nice place.
Uh, I, I would cheerfully live there.
Of course it's not my home,
and I've lived in my home in, well, almost ten years,
and, you know, I've got everything just exactly like I want it.
Right.
But if I were to live some place else, it certainly meets my standards.
It's a nice house.
Uh-huh,
yeah,
that's a nice area.
Is it on the golf course?
No,
it's not,
it's off the golf course,
and I'll be honest with you,
I'm going to have to get a map to figure out exactly where is the golf course versus where my house is.
Is that right.
But it's in the estates that adjoin it.
Yeah,
right,
right.
Well that's a nice area.
Yes,
it is.
That really is a nice area.
When they get that highway finished, you can hop on that and get anywhere you need to go fairly quick.
Yeah,
that one nine that one ninety is just going to be the the outermost loop around.
Right,
another belt line, just, uh, farther out.
Right,
just continue to do that.
Right,
right,
right.
Where are you from in California?
Southern California.
San Diego?
I've lived in San Diego for six years when I was a younger, and L A area,
and my parents live in Anaheim right now.
Lived up north of Los Angeles in Thousand Oaks area, where the Cowboys have their training camp, or used to anyway.
I've been through all of that.
Yeah.
Uh, there is an area beyond Thousand Oaks, north of Los Angeles that is really an eerie, strange looking area with boulders,
I
they're not really hills,
they're more like just huge boulders with very little vegetation.
Huh.
I'm not familiar with what,
is it along the coast or or inland.
Uh. Well, you know, it may be a little bit more inland.
That is one of the strangest areas I have ever seen.
Um.
Uh, I had to go up to T I on business a couple years ago
Out there,
uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
and we went up that coastline,
and I was just amazed how unusual that looks.
Huh.
Here, hang on just a second,
I've got a Los Angeles map.
Let me just quick
Yeah,
valley.
Yes
Okay,
I know where that is.
beyond Thousand Oaks.
I know where Valley is,
I've been out there before,
sure.
You don't think that's strange looking.
I didn't notice anything strange, I guess about it.
Oh, okay
maybe, maybe I'm used to Texas.
Maybe Texas the way,
The elevation is extremely high.
Uh-huh.
It's got curving roads on it,
but, but the,
it's just a strange landscape,
there's very little vegetation.
Huh.
I didn't, I don't remember seeing that part of it.
I know Valley,
yeah,
it's just a suburb of L A.
Right.
It's a,
And they've built some new highways out to that area, and things, lately.
People can get in and out of L A easier.
Maybe it's a place I went to,
it was far extreme, thought we'd never find the place.
Huh.
It was interesting. Because we went out the Ventura highway to Thousand Oaks and on up through that way.
Yeah,
sounds interesting.
Right.
Right,
right.
I, I know exactly that area.
It's a nice area out there.
I love Thousand Oaks.
Uh, Texas, I don't know,
thing, things,
you just have less a variety, I guess.
I think, I don't think it's quite as green, you know.
It's green with all the trees and things out here
but it's just,
Oh, it's green sometime.
Yeah,
but it's just, you know,
I don't know.
Well, it doesn't stay green, you know
Right.
the really,
and in all honesty,
I know this sounds like a Texas story,
all honesty, you haven't seen the hottest of summers if you've only been here five years.
We haven't had a really bad one,
Yeah
I missed that one of eighty or eighty-two or eighty-one that had the heat wave.
Oh.
It may be eighty-two, because we bought our house in eighty-one
and we built a pool in eighty-two,
