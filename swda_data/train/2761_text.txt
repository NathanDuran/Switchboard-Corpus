Okay,
what are your suggestions in making a family reunion successful
Have a big family, I guess,
that's a start.
Well I guess so.
Have  you had any in the
well how old are you?
Twenty-five,
so,
Okay
so you  you have been to some family reunions, perhaps.
I just got married.
Right,
every four years on one side of my family they plan on having, uh, like my grandparents and all their brothers and sisters and then all their kids and grandkids.
Now how long in advance do they, uh, let them know?
Well, we plan on it,
it's like the third weekend in August,
Uh-huh.
so  it's every four years
and so,
So they all know it.
Yeah
and then, you know, arrangements are made like during the Summer for you know, um, food and who's, who's staying where, because a lot of people are from down here, in Texas.
Uh-huh,
uh-huh.
And, uh, a lot of my family is in Indiana.
That's where I'm originally from.
Yes.
So, um, we usually meet like at my uncle's cottage in the, um, at the lake and, uh, make a couple days of it.
Well that sounds like fun,
do they all have the small children too, that come?
Yeah,
pretty much.
So all ages.
Yeah
and, uh, you know, there's some my age
and then there are some a lot younger, an, about four generations, I guess.
Well my husband has, uh, on one side has an extended family,
Uh-huh.
and  they don't ever plan it as, like you do.
Uh-huh
I think  if you can count on it every four years then people have it in mind
so they have to start talking about it, or getting their act together about six months ahead to get in touch with everybody,  because  they're rather socially active too.
Uh-huh.
Yeah.
And  so it has, it seems by doing it about six months ahead, they can pretty much get everybody there.
If they don't, you know, they'll say, oh we're planning to go so and so that, go to, to a certain place that weekend with somebody else
and we're already locked in
but six months ahead has seemed to be okay for them.
Uh-huh.
My family, uh, my parents are the youngest of very large families.
Oh.
Therefore, they don't have many people left.
Yeah.
And, uh, the few previous ones I've had, uh,
I haven't known many of those people,
but, uh, in the last few years it really has just been our immediate family
and that's been very nice,
with, uh,
I have one sister,  and  three brothers
Uh-huh.
and they're only three out of five of us who have children.
Oh.
So, uh, we get to spend a lot of quality time with each other.
Yeah.
And  that's kind of nice because my husband's family reunions are so large,
Uh-huh.
and  they don't see each other very often,
we don't really know many of them.
Yeah,
that's kind of bad.
It really is,
they're fun,
they're a lot of fun,
Yeah.
but,  uh, still, uh, they're not done on a regular basis
and, uh, you kind of forget what happened, and who they were from the time before.
Yeah,
it's, it's fun getting together with immediate family.
A lot of my cousins are real close
and we always get together during holidays and weddings and stuff like that,
so.
Uh, those are the ones that are in Texas?
Uh, no,
Or you  go to Indiana on that?
the ones in Indiana,
uh-huh.
Uh-huh,
where in Indiana?
Lafayette.
Lafayette, I don't know where,
I used to live in Indianapolis.
Yeah,
it's a little north of Indianapolis, about an hour.
Yeah,
yeah,
it's very pretty country in there I think,
it's gorgeous.
Uh-huh,
so.
Well I,
uh, when is your next one, uh, scheduled now.
Well it's like, the last one was my high school graduation
the next one was when I graduated from college,
so I guess about two more years.
Yes, well,
and do you think you'll have a baby to take back with you
Uh, maybe,
I don't know,
Maybe
two more  years,
I don't know,
probably.
I mean you need another milestone, you know.
Yeah,
I guess that's, that's what,
I mean I've been married now for about nine months
so that was another milestone, I guess
Yes,
well I'm sure,
and then all of your family probably has not met your husband.
Um, yeah,
he's from Indiana,
Oh, is he?
so they all  met,
yeah.
And, and he's living, your both living in Sherman.
Yeah.
Do you work to T I?
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh,
and does he?
No,
he's trying to get in med school,
so.
Uh-huh,
well, we don't either,
but, uh, I have a friend who, uh, is working on this project.
Oh, really.
Yes,
and,
Are they getting all the data they need?
Well, I don't know, uh,
I, I have a hard time getting, uh, people on the telephone.
Oh really.
Uh-huh, getting through to anybody.
Sometimes I call off and on all day,
Huh.
but  anyway, uh, I guess we're supposed to be talking about family reunions aren't we
But I got off that.
Well we've kind of exhausted everything I guess.
Yes,
well, um, I think we have been talking probably about four and a half minutes.
Oh, okay.
And, uh, uh, we both look forward to going to our next reunions, I'm sure.
Oh yeah.
But it has been fun talking to you.
Well you too.
Thank you.
And maybe I'll talk to you again.
Okay,
good.
Okay,
bye-bye.
Bye-bye.
