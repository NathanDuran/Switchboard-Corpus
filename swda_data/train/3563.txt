A|Okay,|b
A|Lucille, I'm on, on .|sd
B|All right,|b
B|and what,|%
A|And our okay, our topic was,|sd
A|did you hear our topic?|qy
B|Yes.|ny
A|All right,|aa
A|basketball.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|I guess I'm probably a lot like you.|sv
A|I'm a Dallas Maverick fan.|sd
B|Well, I certainly am too.|sd
B|Now tell me what you expect from the Mavericks this year.|ad
A|Well, unfortunately, I don't expect a great deal out of them.|sd
A|They just have too many problems, too many ailments, too many hurt bones, and maybe too much age at this point.|sv
A|You know, when Roy Tarpley just now he messed up on them, it just hurt them so bad.|sv
A|I feel like everyone else,|sd
B|Um.|%
A|I feel sorry for Donald Carter and the members of the team and the management team and everyone else.|sd
A|It just seems like they were just getting themselves in a position where they could possibly be a final, a final team playing for all of it.|sv
B|Yes, sir.|aa
A|National championship or the world championship, and something like this happens.|sd
B|Oh.|b
B|Well, do you think it's time that we go for new, uh, coaches?|qy
B|Is that part of our problem?|qy
A|Yeah,|ny
A|I think at this time, we're just in a, a rebuilding type of phase, you know.|sv
A|I think that probably be evident with the more and more, the more and more young guys they draft.|sv
A|But,|%
B|Well, it just, it's so discouraging that they can't really,|sv
B|I mean, they're entitled to more than they've been able to do so far.|sv
B|I, I'm awfully sorry that the Mavericks can't come on and, and do.|sd
B|Roy, who's your next best team,|qw
B|or who do you like after the Mavericks?|qw
A|Oh, gosh,|ba
A|I'm so much a Maverick, Maverick fan I don't know.|sd
A|Probably the Boston Celtics.|sd
A|I've just always like the Boston Celtics.|sd
A|They have a, they have a similar situation in that a lot of old guys on the team,|sv
A|and, but they're still playing good ball.|sv
B|Well.|%
A|But I'm, I've always been a Boston Celtic fan, too,|sd
A|but, you know, I've lived in Texas since seventy-four,|sd
A|so being a transplanted Texan in, in the Dallas area, I have to stick with those Dallas Mavericks.|sd
B|We certainly need to support them,|sv
B|do we not.|^g
A|Yes,|ny
A|we do. You know.|sd
B|Do you go to the game?|qy
A|Yes,|ny
A|I go to a few games.|sd
A|I haven't been to many.|sd
A|I'm not a season ticket holder or anything.|sd
A|I was a season ticket holder of the Cowboys for years,|sd
A|and when my kids got to a certain age and went off to school and college and doing their own thing, sort of gets boring going by yourself|sd
B|Yes,|aa
B|it does|sv
B|I'm sure it would in such a monstrous place down there.|sv
A|Oh, you bet.|aa
B|But, um, maybe next, maybe they can do some.|sv
B|I don't know,|h
B|who do they need to trade?|qw
A|Well, I don't know.|no
A|It seems like Rolando Blackman and, and Harper sort of carry the team,|sv
A|they just,|%
A|I don't know,|h
A|I'm afraid to say, that's probably who they need to trade to get someone in there good,|sv
A|but, and that can really help the team,|sv
A|but they do that,|sv
A|they trade the nucleus of their power right now.|sv
B|Yes, sir,|aa
B|it seems that way to me.|sd
B|I, course I don't know any of the newer ones that they have|sd
B|and I'm not well versed on their capabilities,|sd
B|but we really need to do something.|sv
A|Well, you know, I feel like, uh, the best they can hope for this year is probably an opportunity to make the playoffs.|sd
A|I like their coach.|sd
A|I really like a lot,|sd
A|and I just, I think he deserves a good break.|sv
A|I think he deserves a healthy team so they can really see what he can do for the club.|sv
A|I think Donald Carter, the owner, I think with all he's invested, he deserves a a healthy team for one year and a good break also.|sv
B|I really.|%
B|Yes, sir.|ba
A|This thing with Roy Tarpley just upset everyone, I think. Fans, owners, management, everyone.|sv
B|And they have just done as much as they can for that man,|sv
B|and he apparently can't straighten his act out,|sd
B|so we need to, to build on something more positive than that.|sv
A|You bet.|aa
A|I think they're fools if they ever bring him back|sv
B|Oh, I do, too.|aa
B|I certainly would agree to that.|sd
A|Hate to put it that way.|sd
A|I just would not believe him any more.|sd
B|Well, it, um,|%
B|I mean, you can't give, anyone too many chances|sv
A|No.|aa
B|and I think he has gone over the limit.|sv
A|There's an old saying you can, you can lead a horse to water|sd
A|but you can't make him drink.|^q
A|So,|%
B|That's right.|aa
A|And I think Tarpley's just a sad case.|sv
B|Well.|%
A|But to be making a, a million dollars a year, that's pretty sad.|sv
B|It is tragic.|aa
B|I don't, um,|%
B|I mean, we're going to have to do something about all of these fabulous salaries they're paying to all of our athletes, I think.|sv
A|Oh, I think you're right.|aa
A|Everything has been put out of perspective now.|sv
A|You know, you take a, a young kid Roy Tarpley's age, I'd say he was twenty-one when he came into the league,|sd
A|and now he's probably an old age of, uh, twenty-five or six and making all that money,|sd
B|Yes, sir.|ba
A|well, that's, uh, that's quite a, that's a little more of a challenge for a young man than they, they need at that point in their life, I think.|sv
B|I think you're right.|aa
B|I believe that one,|sd
B|so.|%
A|I think, you know, it's created by,|sv
