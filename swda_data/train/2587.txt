B|But, uh,|%
B|Yeah.|b
B|We have, uh, a news thing on the computer that, uh, that I'll, I'll try to look at every day.|sd

A|Yeah.|b
B|Which isn't, you know, pretty much what we look for anyway.|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|But, uh. I, do you think that the quality of the, uh, the, you know, the news events that you get are,|sv
B|what do you think about it?|qo
A|Well I, I guess it's pretty good.|sv
A|And, and like the Dallas area,|%
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and I, I guess when you're in a big metropolitan area like this,|sv
A|there's, I guess, a lot of pressure in that business to,  borderline at that.|sv
B|Yeah.|b
B|Well, you know, there's a lot of competition in the media.|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And sometimes I think it too much trying to figure out who's going to get the best headlines. And that they'll run a topic into the ground.|sv
A|Yeah.|b
B|And, uh. You know, they try to play public's opinion. Which I think is awful, because it usually works.|sv
A|Uh-huh,|aa
A|true.|aa
A|I'll bet that was the case of the, the war in the Middle East.|sv
B|Yes,|aa
B|uh-huh.|aa
B|That,|%

A|Trying to think what else is,  is current.|^h
B|Right.|b
B|Uh, uh,|b
A|Well, um, I don't know what to say|sd

A|they, uh,|%
A|looks like we're going to have an income tax in Texas,|sv
B|Yeah,|aa
B|I hate to see that,|sd
B|but it's, uh, that, you know, if what it's going to take,|%
B|well, you know, we can deduct that from our income tax, our federal income tax.|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|But, uh, you know, but we need good schools.|sv
B|Uh, we're more involved in that now.|sv
B|And, I, I, I, I think it's better for everybody if we had better schools.|sv

A|that's true.|aa
B|So,|%
A|I would think they could find a better way to fund it though,|sv
A|but they haven't for,|%
B|No.|aa
B|You know, I wish they could have gotten a lottery.|sd
A|Well, they're struggling with it.|sv
B|Yeah.|aa
B|I think, you know, the lottery could have helped, with that.|sv
B|I mean, it wouldn't have been as painful as what we would've paid in state income tax.|sv
B|I mean, probably would have paid the same amount|sv
B|but, you know, it's not the idea of your paying, uh, income tax.|sv
A|Uh-huh.|aa
A|True.|ba
B|So,|%
A|I, I'm not sure there's a positive solution for that.|sv

B|It'll be interesting to see what happens.|sv
A|Trying to think what else is current.|^h
B|I, you know, I haven't seen the news in a couple of days.|sd
B|So it, uh,|%

A|Yeah,|b
A|it begins to make you wonder why we didn't go ahead and go on in and,  finish the job while we were in there.|sv
B|Yeah.|b
B|Right.|aa
B|But I understand why Bush, you know, doesn't want to go in and, and uh, take sides.|sd
B|I mean, because that would definitely look like another Korea,|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and he'd have all these people jumping down his back, even though I'd agree with it.|sv
B|I think he ought to, should've gone in there and blew them away.|sv
