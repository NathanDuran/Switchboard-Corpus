A|Do you want to tell me about your budgeting plan?|qy
B|Yeah,|ny
B|our budgeting plan includes me getting a job|sd
B|We're, we're at the point now,|sd
B|I I quit working about six months ago to start this house|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and I'm out of cash|sd
B|and I'm not out of project yet.|sd
A|Oh, no.|ba
B|So, uh, I'm going to go back and do some consulting work.|sd
B|As far as budget's concerned, I'm, I'm fairly fortunate.|sd
B|Uh, we've, we're right now where if we don't buy anything extra, we can make it on what my wife makes.|sd
B|So, you know, the project's kind of halted until then.|sd
B|But as far as budgeting is concerned, you know, we have, uh, some pretty strict guidelines that we go for, you know,|sd
B|we always put ten percent back,|sd
B|and that's a never touch.|sd
A|Uh, into savings.|bf
B|Yeah.|aa
A|Oh.|b
B|Either savings or investment, one of the two,|sd
B|but we don't ever put it in a high risk.|sd
B|It's just always going to be there.|sd
A|Well, that's pretty good.|ba
B|And as far as the rest of it's concerned, we don't have any kind of, uh, what I would call extravagant expenses, you know,|sv
B|we, uh, we pretty much live on about eight, nine hundred a month, you know, just travel to and from work and clothing and food|sd
A|Boy, that's pretty good.|ba
B|and the rest of it, you know, we pile into the house.|sd
B|And, uh, you know, I'm fairly fortunate.|sv
B|I mean, our credit cards are out to the max right now because I'm a little behind on that,|sd
A|Sure.|b
B|but, uh, we're still making the payments on them.|sd
B|It's just, when you,|sd
B|see in Texas you cannot borrow the money to build your own home  and do it yourself.|sd
A|Yeah,|b
A|it's, it's tough here too.|sd
A|You have to have the contractor sign with you.|sd
B|Right,|aa
B|exactly.|aa
A|But it's easy to find a contractor for a couple of hundred bucks who'll sign it and let you do it|sv
B|Yeah.|b
A|, where I live, that is.|sd
B|And where I live, it, it's pretty scary, because Texas is one of those strange states where if you have a contractor sign on your note like that and you screw up, you don't get it finished,|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|the bank can eat the contractor.|sd
A|Oh, bad for him, huh.|bf
B|Yeah,|aa
B|bad for him.|sd
B|But, the homeowner can't be touched.|sd
A|Um.|%
B|It's a homestead state.|sd
A|Is that right?|qy
B|Yeah,|ny
B|see right now if I quit paying any of my bills,|sd
B|the only thing they could do is cut off electricity.|sd
B|They can't take your land unless you don't pay your land taxes. Period.|sd
A|Wow.|ba
B|You know. They can take your car and your clothes and your, anything|sd
B|that's not the tools of your trade,|sd
B|but as far as, uh, you know you're pretty much bullet proof in this state.|sv
A|Well, that's kind of handy.|sv
B|Yeah.|b
A|I just finished James Michener's TEXAS book.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|Pretty interesting.|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|Texas has quite the history.|sv
B|Well, you know, we're, we're not ones to budget much, you know|sd
B|We just going to spend it all.|sd
A|That's kind of what we do.|sd
A|We, uh, we're L D S|sd
A|and so we pay ten percent tithing|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and then, you know, we put I guess it's like fifteen to twenty percent into a savings account.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|But that sometimes we use for emergency type things.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|But, uh, and my wife doesn't work.|sd
A|We're fortunate that way, that I make enough to do what we want to do.|sv
B|Yeah,|b
B|yeah,|b
B|we're pretty, pretty fortunate as far as the, uh, the budgeting is concerned, because, you know, we don't have any long term debt.|sv
B|You know, uh, we paid cash for car.|sd
B|Well, we bought the car on time, one of them,|sd
B|but we, you know, we since paid it off.|sd
A|Well that's pretty.|ba
B|The land is paid for cash,|sd
B|so we don't have to worry about that.|sd
A|That's a great position to be in.|ba
B|Well, it's fraught with other problems|sd
A|Is that right?|qy
B|Yeah,|ny
B|I'm not very motivated|sd
A|Oh|b
A|What kind of consulting do you do?|qw
B|Uh, systems consulting. Computerization for construction firms.|sd
A|Is that right?|bh
B|Yeah.|ny
A|I'm into computers, too.|sd
A|I I'm a E D P auditor.|sd
B|Right.|b
B|Oh.|b
A|And.|%
B|You into mainframes?|qy
A|and P C s.|sd
B|oh really?|bh
A|Yeah.|ny
A|I'm just brushing up on, well, C plus plus.|sd
B|Are you really?|bh
A|Uh-huh.|ny
A|And,|%
B|I just got that a few days ago.|sd
A|Three oh?|qy
B|Oh, gees,|ba
B|don't get me to lying.|ad
B|I bought it at a fire sale.|sd
A|Oh.|b
B|This guy's place burned down,|sd
B|and he had a bunch of computer stuff,|sd
B|and, you know, I bought it all.|sd
B|It was two hundred bucks for everything he had.|sd
A|You got a buy.|ba
B|Well, some of it wasn't worth anything, you know.|sd
A|Sure.|b
B|You know, a lot of the, uh, diskettes were just totally unusable.|sd
A|Melted, or Just wet|bf
A|or,|%
B|Well, yeah|aa
B|, or wet|sd
A|Okay.|b
B|But I did get out of there with, uh, Vermont Views, which is a huge,|sd
