A|Okay,|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
A|well I guess I enjoy eating out, um, uh, here and there,|sd
A|or it's, it's a good change and, a good change from cooking and eating at home|sd
A|and I guess I like a variety of, a variety of restaurants.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|Uh, sometimes it's fun to go out and just have a hamburger and french fries and, and sort of a hamburger and french fry meal,|sd
A|and sometimes it's, I enjoy it's, I enjoy going out having a formal meal.|sd
B|Yes.|b
A|And, uh, sometimes it's nice to go out and have a salad.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|Something, you know,|%
B|Do you usually go out, uh, with the children or without them?|qy
A|Well, a variety.|sd
A|I, I like to go sometimes without them|sd
A|and, sometimes I, sometimes it's okay to take them along.|sd
A|So|%
B|Right|b
A|Sometimes I think we pay the baby-sitter as much as paying for their dinner or lunches|sd
B|Yes.|b
A|so, uh, it just, you know, it just varies,|sd
A|we do a mix.|sd
A|Sometimes it's really nice to be able to go out and eat with just my husband|sd
A|and it wouldn't even really matter which restaurant it was, just to, you know, have a moment of peace and quiet without little ones at the table.|sd
B|Yes.|b
B|Yes.|b
A|So, uh, I guess  I guess actually on those, those times, uh, we even, there are times I even say, oh, please don't sit us next to a table with other children,|sd
B|Well,|%
A|this is our night out.|^q
A|So but, uh, anyway, where do you like to eat?|qw
B|Uh, well, uh, we don't have any children|sd
B|so, uh, we tend to, like to try all sorts of different things.|sd
B|And, uh, we're very attracted to exotic food.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And, uh, we like Indian food, and Thai cuisine and, uh, sort of gourmet Mexican and, uh, things like that, as well as Tex-Mex and Italian and, uh, Chinese and things, and, and things of that sort.|sd
B|Now, yes,|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
B|of course, we like to occasionally go out and get down and dirty with barbecue or hamburgers or something like that, too.|sd
A|Right.|b
B|And, uh, we probably go out one to two times a week.|sd
A|Right.|b
B|And, uh, uh, we're pretty much regulars at an Italian, local Italian restaurant.|sd
A|Oh, which one do you like?|qw
B|Momo's.|sd
A|Oh, okay.|bk
A|Well, it's been a long time since we've been in there|sd
A|but, uh, but it's good.|sv
A|There's an Italian restaurant over, over by the mall, over by, uh, Plano Parkway there,|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|Oh, is it Campari's or something?|qh
B|I've heard about it,|sd
B|I haven't been in there.|sd
A|Well, it's good.|sd
A|I haven't, my husband had been in there several times|sd
A|and we went in there, actually we went in there for lunch one day.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And, uh, their pastas were great.|sd
B|that's one of the things, a good pasta means a lot to me.|sd
B|I, I like different kinds of food.|sd
B|So, when we go out, I'm always looking for something other than the standard menu, even if, it's a Mexican Restaurant, like something other than, uh, you know the standard tacos, enchiladas, tamales and  fajitas now.|sd
A|You're brave|sv
B|Yes,|aa
B|yes|aa
B|and once in a while things backfire.|sd
B|I mean, we've gone for Romanian food and Lebanese food, and things like that|sd
A|Oh, God.|ba
B|And I'm not fond of some of those things|sd
B|but we'll try, we'll try anything.|sd
A|Right.|b
B|Ethiopian, we've had Ethiopian. And, uh, not in Plano of course|sd
A|No,|aa
A|I don't think so|sv
B|But, we really, we really do enjoy going out|sd
B|and uh, and, um, I'm pretty adventurous in cooking, too, which also occasionally backfires.|sd
A|Oh, well. Even though traditional it can backfire.|sv
B|Yeah.|aa
B|I think we're supposed to say what will bring us back to a restaurant or, or what attracts us to a restaurant.|sd
B|How do you usually find a, a new restaurant?|qw
A|Uh, well my husband's kind of the he, he's the ethnic fan.|sd
A|So he's,|%
A|I don't know.|h
A|You know what, we read, we read the, uh, D MAGAZINE|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|So do we.|sd
A|we, we check that and, uh, the Friday section in the newspaper the pull out section there.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|They often do ratings of restaurants,|sd
A|so|%
B|Right.|b
A|uh, we've, uh, we've usually, we often save those and ventured out on, from there, uh, just for something that had a high rating.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|We have found, uh, a number of restaurants either through D and the, Friday paper and sometimes the, the OBSERVER. Which my husband usually picks up. And also through coupons.|sd
A|Okay.|b
B|When a new restaurant opens up, they usually send out coupons.|sd
A|That's,  That's right.|aa
B|And you know, when they say, you know, buy one get one free. It's hard to resist,|sd
B|so we'll go in.|sd
B|And very often we'll, find a place that we like|sd
B|and we'll stick with it|sd
B|once they, give, they no longer give coupons. We'll, we'll, uh, we'll stay there.|sd
A|Oh good.|ba
A|Oh, good.|ba
B|But we've found probably half of our sort of regular restaurants through coupons, and the other half through the, through the newspaper reviews.|sd
A|Oh. Oh, yeah.|aa
A|We, I guess we, we use the coupons, too.|sd
A|That's true.|aa
A|That's true.|aa
B|I mean it's wonderful, particularly if you have more than two people and you've got say four or something like that.|sd
B|It's very expensive to go out to eat.|sv
A|Oh right.|aa
A|Right.|aa
B|So, yeah|b
B|that, that is really one of our,|sd
B|it's almost a hobby with us.|sd
A|Well I think that it's just, that's sometimes I think going out to eat it's, it's sort of a recreation.|sv
B|Yes.|b
A|So, uh, just a, just a change of pace from, uh, eating at home.|sv
B|Yes.|b
A|So, uh  anyway. I guess, uh, as far as, as far as service when we go out gosh, it's nice, it's nice to have someone come and wait the table. And clear the table and,|sd
B|Yeah.|b
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Oh, absolutely.|aa
B|And do the dishes|^2
A|Yeah,|aa
A|and do the dishes.|b^m
A|And, uh, actually it's kind of nice to, you know,|sv
A|I always,|%
A|uh, a waitress or waiter that waits the table, it's nice that they're attentive|sv
A|but it's not nice when they're too attentive.|sv
B|Oh, yes.|aa
A|So, uh, we've had experience with that, too.|sd
A|So,|%
B|my sister, who also lives here in Dallas, uh, tends to, uh, chat with waiters and waitresses and become their best friends during the course of dinner, which drives me absolutely batty.|sd
A|Oh, yeah.|aa
A|Well, how we|%
B|but ,|%
A|it may, it may help their tip, may not, huh.|sv

B|You know, we've never been there.|sd
A|Well  well, you would like it.|sv
B|And that's supposed to be wonderful.|sd
B|Um.|%
A|You'd like it especially it you're adventuresome.|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|It just, we've, we've taken people there several times|sd
A|and, uh, they have a good, they have a good choice of things that are very different sounding.|sd
A|I guess, it's, whether you call it Southwestern|sd
A|but, uh, oh we had venison venison chili one time. Which was absolutely wonderful.|sd
B|Ooh.|ba
A|And then I guess it must be seasonal|sd
A|and we've been back,|sd
A|oh, I guess it's in the winter season|sd
A|well they've never had it when we've been back,|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|so. But, uh, well you ought to try that.|ad
