All right.
I think that gets us off to discussing the topic for tonight.
Which is movies,
correct?
That is correct.
Okay.
Are you  a movie buff?
Um, yeah.
I don't like going to see them in the theaters
but outside of that, rent a lot,
watch them on T V mostly.
Well, I have a V C R
and I see most all of mine there.
What have you seen recently that you enjoyed?
Uh, I don't know, um,
actually earlier tonight we were watching TO LIVE AND DIE IN L A.
Have you seen that movie?
No,
I haven't.
It's a kind of one of those psycho ones.
Now, I, I live alone.
Consequently, I don't like these psycho things.
Oh, it's not too bad.
One of those cop thrillers
but,
Oh, okay.
Have you seen the
if,
do you have a V C R?
Yes,
we do.
Have you seen the movie CLASS ACTION with Gene Hackman?
Uh, no,
I haven't yet.
I saw it this weekend
and it is, uh, to me an outstanding movie.
I thoroughly enjoyed it.
He is, uh, an attorney and his daughter is an attorney
and she has a suit against his company.
You know, it's one of those things.
Yeah,
that,
But  there's a lot of
well, it's just it's something that anyone can watch and enjoy.
He's a good actor though.
Beg your pardon?
Um, Gene Hackman's a good actor.  I think.
Yes,
he is.
Do you see HOOSIERS?
Yes.
I've seen HOOSIERS.
Saw it just again the other night,  for,
Yeah,
actually I, we saw her just the other night too.
Oh, did you?
Yeah.
It's one of our favorite movies.
I, I live with, um, a roommate and my girlfriend the three of us.
We've seen that movie probably six times in the last six months.
Have you seen the movie, um, CROSSING DELANCY?
Yeah.
Now, that's one I have watched, oh, six or eight times.
I always feel so good when I get through with that movie.
Yeah,
I like those movies that you watch time and time again.
I do too.
DIRTY DANCING and CROSSING DELANCY are two of my favorite.
So, well what business are you in?
I'm, I'm an electrical engineer.
Oh.
In New Hampshire.
All right.
I work  in Massachusetts actually.
Oh, all right.
Okay.
So is everything going all right up there?
Um, it's only about, um, half an hour.
I live on the border.
Oh, well that's that bad then.
Half an hour, we do that just going to downtown Dallas.
That's right.
So,
See we live up in tax free New Hampshire and drive down to Massachusetts to work.
That makes a lot of sense
But, um, we,
are you a native of that part of the country?
Yeah,
I grew up in New Hampshire.
It seems, southern town,
it's called
It's, I don't know, fifteen minutes from the border and five minutes from the main border. *main = Maine?
We live right in the corner.
Oh.
That one little spot in New Hampshire, we have ten miles of coastline,
I live on one of that little ten mile spot.
Uh, sounds wonderful.
Did you have damage this year with hurricanes?
Not up, um, where I live
but further down the coast in Massachusetts they got hit pretty bad.
I happened to be in Nassau
and we got the backlash of that thing.
And they had record high waves, thirty year high waves come in there,
and it was quite an experience
so.
Well, what movies are you looking forward to seeing now?
Um, well, I'm, I'm only twenty-seven years old
so THE DOORS movie, that's out on video. I want to watch that.
Okay.
Have you seen GREEN CARD?
That would be pretty good.
No,
I haven't seen that one.
That's a real warm movie.
It, it really just turned out nicely.
So I would recommend that if you have a chance.
I'm in for it.
We rent a lot of movies
so we, we often sit around and say, what movies should we rent?
And we  don't know.
Well if you,  if you can get GREEN CARD, go for it.
All right,
we'll try that one.
I have been working at, uh, as an accountant at the medical school here in Dallas
and I have watched, uh, GROSS ANATOMY.
Have you seen that one?
Yeah,
I did.
Okay.
And I don't know
I can associate with some of the people in that movie because of the young students I see over at the medical school.
But I hope you have a very Merry Christmas.
You too.
I'm looking forward to it.
I think we're going to have a white Christmas up here just like the song says.
Well,
