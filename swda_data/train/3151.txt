B|Well, how do you feel about spot spot testing for drugs?|qo
A|Well, basically I think it would be a good idea myself.|arp_nd
A|I, uh, I think if somebody's not on drugs, they have no reason, you know, to be afraid of it.|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|Uh, I do think that there has to be some controls, uh,|sv
A|like, I don't think one test positive should, uh, be, uh, the end of it, you know.|sd
B|Right.|b
A|I, I think they should test more than once.|sv
B|Yeah,|aa
B|it's, it's  it's refreshing to hear somebody, that has a similar opinion as mine.|sv
A|It,|%
B|I mean, all these people that are against it that may, you know, they may not even be on drugs.|sv
B|They, they call it an invasion of privacy.|sv
A|Uh-huh|b
B|And I don't see that.|sv
B|To me that just doesn't sound like a valid argument because this company is paying you good money that you're working for|sv
A|That's right.|aa
B|and they, I believe that, they have the right to know if you're using a, a dangerous substance|sv
A|Uh-huh.|aa
A|Uh-huh.|aa
B|But,|%
A|There's so many jobs that, uh, really have other people's lives in their hands or even their own life|sv
A|and, you know, and it's, uh|%
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|uh, how can you do anything about a problem besides if you don't know about it?|qh
B|Right.|b
A|You know, and I just, um, I, I think  there definitely needs to be some control to it.|sv
B|Right .|b
A|I guess it is possible to have a false positive report.|sv
B|Yes.|aa
B|No,|ar
B|I, I, I agree that, you know, you, there needs to be a, a well thought out, sane approach to, how to administer that program.|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|Just because you, you, something can get mixed in the mail,|sv
B|or uh, the chemicals could react incorrectly than, than what you would expect them to.|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And, yeah,|%
B|you, you know|%
A|Or somebody's test gets mixed up with somebody else's.|sv
B|Right.|b
A|I mean, those things do happen.|sv
B|Yeah.|b
A|Uh, I certainly wouldn't want people's lives ruined  uh, wrongly.|sd
B|Right,|aa
B|and, you know, I've|%
B|the, the, the company that I work for, uh, has just recently, well, you know, within the last couple of years, instituted for all new hired employees,|sd
B|they submit to a urine test.|sd
A|Uh-huh|b
B|And, they, they say that there's been, you know, they, they, they've also implemented random testing.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And , it hasn't happened to me in the couple of years that, you know, it's been in progress|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|but, uh, I, I fully agree with it|sd
B|and there's, you know, there's all these memos going around about folks that are disgruntled and feel it's an invasion of privacy,|sd
B|and I, I agree with you.|aa
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|If, if, if you feel it's an invasion of privacy, you've, you've probably got something you're trying to hide|sv
A|Yeah|aa
A|and you maybe need to look for some other type of job to do  that, uh, doesn't require the testing.|sv
B|Yeah.|b
B|Right.|b
A|Uh, to me, it's, to me it's not an invasion or privacy.|sv
A|I think it's people have a right to know if, if, uh, their, their life maybe's in jeopardy or, uh, Yeah.|sv
B|Or, the quality of their product.|^2
A|Their work, the work they're doing for their company.|sv
A|Uh, those things are all affected.|sv
A|If not immediately, it certainly does eventually.|sv
B|Yeah.|b
A|I think that's where a lot of the problem is at first.|sv
A|It doesn't seem to, uh, bother the quality of work|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|but eventually it does.|sv
B|Right,|aa
B|because it usually requires more and more of that substance that you're misusing to get the same effect.|sv
A|Uh-huh,|aa
A|uh-huh.|aa
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|Um.|b
A|Course, I feel the same way on the AIDS problem.|sd
A|I, I don't think that's an invasion of privacy,|sv
A|that's the only communicable disease that they're not allowed to test for you know,|sd
A|and it's destroying a lot of   people's lives|sv
B|and then   and one of the few that they don't have a cure for|sd
A|Yeah,|aa
A|and it's, you know, it's, it's destroying people's lives|sv
A|and I, I think that person, plus anybody in danger should, should know about it and be aware of it.|sv
B|Yeah.|aa
A|I don't know.|h
A|It's, it's kind of hard to|sv
A|I guess the gay movement has had a lot to do with considering that, that, uh, an invasion of privacy.|sv
A|Of course, that's not supposed to be what we're talking about today, I guess.|sd
A|So, I kind of get off on a tangent here.|sd
B|Yeah|b
A|Uh, do you work for, uh, Texas Instruments?|qy
B|Yes,|ny
B|I do.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And I'm, I'm down in the, the central,|sd
B|but I don't know how familiar you are with Texas,|qw^d
B|but I'm in a, we live in a town, uh, near a town called Temple. Which is right in between Waco and Austin on the freeway.|sd
A|Um.|b
A|Oh, that's probably why,|sd
A|my brother did live in Grapevine, Texas.|sd
A|That's near Dallas.|sd
B|Right.|b

B|Um.|b
B|Wow.|ba
A|So.|%
B|How about that?|bh
A|So.|%
B|Well, I hope you do get some rain up there.|sd
A|Um So do I|aa
B|I|%
A|Uh, I can't think of anything else, uh.|sd
B|Yeah,|b
B|I, I guess being in agreement  kind of tends to limit the conversation  you know|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Uh, I can understand|ba
A|I know if somebody is using drugs and doesn't think there's anything wrong with them, I can see them objecting. You know?|sv
A|there's a lot of people that think that there's nothing wrong with .|sv
B|One of the things I found interesting,|sd
B|it, it's funny that you mentioned that,|sd
B|T I is pretty much a worldwide company|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and we have manufacturing plants all around the world including some places where the use of certain drugs that are illegal here are not illegal.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Um. Uh-huh,|b
A|uh-huh.|b
B|Yeah,|b
B|they don't have to submit to drug testing like, like they do here in the States and some places abroad.|sd
A|Oh, I'll be darn.|ba
B|Yeah,|b
B|I thought that was kind of interesting too.|sd
A|Yeah,|b
A|yeah,|b
A|the different cultures and that  too, uh|sd
B|Yeah.|b
B|I mean, uh, uh, from a quality standpoint, that's not, I mean, just because it's not illegal doesn't mean it doesn't affect you the same way.|sv
A|No,|aa
A|no.|aa
A|I'm sure it would have to affect you the same way.|sv
A|I, I can't think that would make any difference  whether it was legal or not,|sv
B|Yeah.|b
B|Right.|b
A|it, it would still have to affect you the same way.|sv
B|Yeah,|aa
B|but, like if you're going to do business in another country, you've got to respect their rules.|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|I mean if, if, you know, that, that's the trade off.|sv
A|Oh yeah.|aa
A|You can't you go by their laws.|aa
B|Yeah.|b
A|The same way our people have to go by their laws when they're over there.|sv
A|That's why a lot get in trouble because they have to follow their rules|sv
B|Huh|b
A|and, uh some of the countries are very much against drugs|sv
B|Right.|b
A|and you use them, you pay for it|sv
B|Usually with you life in some places.|sv
A|Yeah,|aa
A|a lot of them.|sv
A|Yeah.|aa
A|Where, where  is it they lose the, if they steal they lose a thumb or a finger?|qw
B|That's right.|aa
B|Yeah,|b
B|from the Middle East.|sd
A|Is that where it is?|qy
B|Yeah.|ny
B|Iraq, Iran, in that area.|sd
A|I thought, wow|ba
B|Yeah|b
A|You know, that's quite a deterrent|sv
B|Well, in Saudi Arabia, you know, using, uh, alcohol and drugs and something like that, you get the death penalty.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
A|Yeah.|b
B|So, it's pretty strict over there|sv
A|Yeah.|aa
A|So I guess, you know, we, we have so many freedoms over here we sometimes forget about how   great out country really is.|sv
B|Well, people tend to  take the first amendment out of context. Which, which means you know, I could do anything I want to|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and you can't stop me,|^q
B|and you know|%
A|They, they abuse it is what they do.|sv
