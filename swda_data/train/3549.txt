A|What are you guys having for Christmas?|qo
B|What are we having?|^h
B|Let's see|^h
B|Well, I'm not planning the menu.|sd
A|Oh, you're not.|bh
B|No|nn
B|We usually go out to either one of our folks,|sd
B|they both live close to|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|but, um, I don't know,|sd
B|it seems like a, a big thing for Christmas is usually ham.|sv
A|Well, funny you should mention that.|sd
A|I'm a pig farmer|sd
B|Oh, you are|bh
A|Yeah.|ny
B|huh.|b
A|Well, now, it's kind of a hobby more than anything else,|sd
A|but we're going to have, uh, wild boar|sd
B|My goodness.|ba
A|we, uh, we killed a boar the other day,|sd
A|it was, you know, mating with the sows,|sd
A|and you can't use the piglets, you know,|sd
A|so.|%
B|Huh.|b
A|It's about six months of no use,|sd
A|so, we, uh, we shot him and cleaned him out and had him, you know, processed into ham,|sd
A|and, uh, we're also going to have a little roast suckling pig, because I, I've got one that's got a, a hernia|sd
B|Oh, really.|bh
A|and rather than, you know, pay the vet four hundred dollars for surgery, we'll just cook him and eat him|sd
B|Is that, is that hard?|qy
A|Well, no,|nn
A|hey, I tell you what, preparing a little pig is, is a snap,|sd
A|I'm telling you, real easy, easier than chicken.|sd
B|Oh, really.|bh
A|Yeah,|ny
A|you just, uh,|%
A|you kill him, you know,|sd
A|you probably,|%
A|most guys just shoot them in the head,|sd
A|they go, you know,|sd
A|in a second they're gone|sd
B|Oh.|b
A|and then you just dip the carcass in, uh, boiling water, pull it out, and there's a, we use a little raspy brush, pulls the hair off, and, uh, gut it, and, uh, just stick it down in a pit with some cloves and, uh, some pineapple, about three pineapples, you know, sliced them up, and, uh, cover him up with, uh, wet, uh, sacks, feed sacks is what I usually use *more than one utt??  and then start a charcoal fire on top of him.|sd
B|Huh.|b
B|Oh, my goodness.|ba
A|And after about six hours, you put the fire out and dig that baby out of there,|sd
A|and it's the best eating you ever had.|sd
B|Oh, well, does a boar taste just like regular ham?|qy
A|Yep,|ny
A|just like a pig|sd
B|Does it.|bh
A|I mean, you know, uh, it has a lot less fat.|sd
B|Huh.|b
A|This wild boar weighed probably about three hundred and thirty pounds|sd
B|Oh my.|ba
A|and he dressed out to almost two hundred and ten pounds.|sd
B|Oh, my goodness.|ba
A|Well, you know, we took the skin and the head and the and the feet off,|sd
A|and that was about, you know, a hundred, hundred pounds of just ham.|sd
B|Oh, well, how many people are you planning on serving at Christmas?|qw
A|Oh, well, we're, you know, we're not going to eat the whole thing|sd
B|Eat it all,|b^m
B|yeah|b
A|It would take a year.|sd
A|But, uh, you know, we're going to drive up to Kansas City, see my wife's folks,|sd
A|and, uh, she, she,|%
A|what's, what's what's your mother cooking for Christmas|qw
A|yeah,|%
A|well her mom's doing brisket.|sd
B|I don't,|sd
B|what is brisket?|qw
A|Brisket?|bh
A|It's a part of the cow that they used to throw away.|sd
B|Huh.|b
A|It's just tough as a boot|sd
B|Oh.|b
A|and, uh, you know, they used to use it for leather, I think|sd
B|Oh, my goodness.|ba
A|I mean, no,|ar
A|I was kidding.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|But, uh, it's, it's a part of the loin, you know, the rib cage,|sd
A|and it has a lot of muscle in it and a lot of, gristle where it attaches to the ribs,|sd
A|so it's really, really a tough piece of meat|sd
B|Oh, my goodness.|ba
A|but it's so tasty, you can't stand it.|sd
B|Huh.|b
A|So you just take it|sd
A|and you marinate it for a couple of days|sd
B|And that softens it up, huh.|bf
B|Huh.|b
A|And then, uh, you just put it in the oven,|sd
A|takes about four hours to cook one.|sd
A|They weigh about anywhere from ten to twenty pounds.|sd
B|Oh, gee.|ba
A|And, uh, we're going to have that.|sd
B|Well, what else do you serve with your pig?|qw
A|Oh, well, we'll have cranberries and hominy|sd
A|and, uh, we, we are, we're big on olives and cucumbers and stuff up here.|sd
B|Huh.|b
A|We have olives, black olives and cucumbers and, uh, tomatoes,|sd
A|we still have tomatoes|sd
B|Oh, do you?|bh
A|yeah,|ny
A|fresh tomatoes.|sd
B|Oh, we, we just got lots of snow|sd
A|Well, it started to freeze up around here, you know,|sd
A|there's nothing between you and us but our barb wire, and half of that's down.|sd
A|I mean it's thirty degrees this morning.|sd
B|Oh, really.|bh
A|Yeah.|ny
B|Huh.|b
A|But, uh, it'll go up to fifty or sixty almost.|sd
B|Oh, my goodness.|ba
B|I didn't know it got that low at night.|sd
A|Oh, yeah.|aa
A|Well, it's desert, you know,|sd
A|where, where we are, it's, it's, it's, uh, the edge of the desert,|sd
A|I mean, it's part of the Great Plains.|sd
A|So in the day time in the summer it goes up to a hundred, hundred and ten|sd
B|Oh, gee.|ba
A|and at night it goes down to about sixty.|sd
B|My goodness.|ba
A|Yeah,|aa
A|we get a fifty degree temperature swing in about four hours.|sd
B|Oh, boy.|ba
A|So everything that lives around here is real tough|sd
B|Oh|b
A|That's trees, you know,|sd
A|we got hundred year old trees that are, you know, twenty feet tall.|sd
B|Oh, gee.|ba
A|That's all the bigger they get,|sd
A|they, you know, they're just hard as a rock.|sd
