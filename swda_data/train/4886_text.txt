Are you in the middle of anything?
No.
I'm not in the middle of anything.
I've just,
about the last thing I did
about maybe, oh, close to a year ago now I guess, I, I helped my dad add on another bedroom on to his house.
So,  I guess that,
The whole thing?
Yeah.
That, that was fairly large undertaking.
A, a, it's a bedroom and a walk-in closet and a bathroom all on one side of the house.
Did the framing and all?
Oh, we did it all except for the sheetrocking.
Huh.
That was the only thing we didn't, you know, putting the ceiling up and things like that
we don't, we, we weren't sure how to do that
and.
and I did all the sheetrocking and the interior work
Yeah,
that's the exact opposite.
We did all, put the roof up and did all the roofing and the, put all the interior walls up.
We just didn't do any of the sheetrock wall work
and that's it because you have, you know, get those joints to go together
and whatever you have to put in there to get the, to take the gaps out between the sheets and on the ceiling and all that.
Yeah.
I we didn't know a thing about any of that
and  so,  It's, it looked very hard to do
My  wife wishes I hadn't done that.
so,
we figured well just,
I didn't think we could do it and make it look professional.
So, we left it, left it to somebody who does it for a living.
But,
I think it takes about three or four times before it gets easy. Yeah *should be 'b'
Probably so
and I, we'd never done it
so we just left it alone.
But that's,
I guess, I'm only twenty-one
so I, my, my vast experience of home, home owner's knowledge is not very much.
So it's just what I have to do, more or less, around the house, you know, for my parents
so.
Did you, you framed it in uh, on, on, you framed in new square footage
or was it stuff that was already, uh,  enclosed?
It was brand  new.
Brand new  .
We started  with the backyard and turned it into part of the house
so  it was,
and  you knew how, you knew how to do the framing?
Uh, well my dad knew how to do most of it,  you know.
Uh-huh.
He, he'd, we'd gotten a couple of books
and then he just started doing it.
I don't know.
He, well he did all the flooring himself.
He put the whole, the whole floor in
and then I just started with the walls and the roof and started there.
And then we were, put a, like a, not, not necessarily a garage, but just like a, off the side of that
after we had the house part made, we just decided we'd carry the roof out a little bit farther and put a carport more or less.
It's not, you know, it's not enclosed.
It's just somewhere to drive another car to, to park
and it's,
Do, do you build on slabs down there or did you build it up off the ground?
Uh, it's off the ground.
On the piers?
Uh-huh.
It's on about uh, twenty-two inch piers, something like that.
Did,
You had those  poured
So.
or you did them yourself?
Uh, no,
those, those are,
we did those ourselves
so.
You just put forms in the ground and fill them with concrete?
Yeah.
Huh.
Exactly,
so.  It's,
Well,  the last thing I did completely myself was an outside deck which I was pretty proud of
Yeah,
those those are,
we'd, I've done one,
I helped somebody do one of those before.
Those are, those are, you know,
you can buy them in kits
but we didn't do that way.
But it's,
No
I designed it from scratch and  did it  did a pretty good job.
Yeah.
Those are nice.
They're pretty forgiving, you know.
You can always tear  stuff out and redo it.
It's a,
Yeah,
yeah.
That's not near, like building a house or anything
but,
Yeah,
those are nice.
Especially when you get done, you've got something, you know.
I don't know,
I like them.
You just sit down on on the deck and do whatever.  Have  a barbecue
Yeah.
I  I built it two levels and with a big toy box and some benches and, uh, a backrest and all that stuff.
or,
I,
Yeah,
that sounds nice.
All done by yourself, huh?
I had  a friend with a tractor who dug the pier holes
Designed,
so we could pour concrete and support it with a, a nice firm four by four posts.
And, uh and then the rest of it I just did.
Yeah.
A, a contractor friend helped me, uh, with some of the, uh, foundation work
but, uh, it was pretty,
it was about four or five hundred square feet.
The same size as the addition that I just put on
so.
Yeah.
That's pretty, that's a good size deck.
Yeah.
So, yeah.
That's,
It's, uh,  not that expensive.
I think it cost me three dollars a square foot and, uh, you know, no less than that.
Yeah.
That's not,
cost me about five hundred dollars, six hundred dollars all together.
Yeah,
that's good.
That's not bad at all.
Didn't  have to,
Yeah.
the wood may
it got surprising as to the fact that how much wood is, you know.
To get, to get good lumber it costs,
I don't know about Dallas, but even in this little town, it's, it's not cheap at all.
I was surprised.
I'd be surprised if it wasn't, uh,  cheaper where you are.
It's probably more there.
Well, yeah.
It probably comes from where you are.
Yeah,
yeah,
that it probably does.
Most
I, I'm not sure
but,
When I drive through that area, that's all I see is  pressure treated,  pressure treated lumber yards.
Yeah.
It's nothing but woods up here,  down here.
Yeah.
I don't, I haven't, I mean, I haven't,
I used to live in Dallas. In Arlington, actually.
And, but that was just when I was a kid
so I don't really know what the cost of living is even like in Dallas anymore.
But it's, I don't know, we're a college town
so that doesn't help us out any.
Right.
East Texas.
We have,
gas is a dollar dollar twelve a gallon,
so that's probably about what you're paying
Huh.
so.
Yeah,
my current project is a walkway which I'm building around the house and out to the backyard to, uh, you know, digging it out and laying sand and putting, uh, pavers on top of that
so.
Yeah.
That's a  lot easier.
You've  got something going all the time.
