my number.
Okay.
Okay.
So are you a, a, a golfer
or are you a spectator?
Oh, I'm a,
I play golf
but I don't actually play golf.
Well, I'm the same way.
I,  I go out there  and hit the ball.
Yeah.
Hack it all over the place?
Yeah.
It's sickening, isn't it?
Um, uh, well, in the Carolinas it's, it's just, you know, we've got a bunch of golf courses around here.
Yeah.
We've got tons up here
but I don't know.
How do you feel about your game?
I guess that's a good question?
Uh, well, I mean I'm not a serious golfer at all,
uh, uh, a friend of mine goes golfing a lot
and he drags me out every now and then
and I, uh, I don't have a, I don't really even have a game.
I usually
when I go out and play golf it's usually like at a, at one of these par threes that, you know, you,
Yeah.
but, um, I like watching it on T V.
Yeah,
I like that too.
I  don't know
I try to play,
but God, I, a couple years ago I played two, three times a week and got lousy.
I guess that's the best I ever got was lousy.
And I thought I was really improving and the big break was going to come
and then I got worse again
so.
get they, they say I hit worm burners because I, I can't hit it up in the air.
Yeah.
So I'm pretty bad
but I, I, I get great distance hitting it, you know, across the ground,
and if it's going over water or something one of them have to take the shot for me because I'm,
but I'm getting better.
I've got where now I can hit it in, in the air some of the time.
That's pretty good.
Yeah.
Uh, so I'm kind of a novice at it.
Um, I'm that and worse.
I, I play
next year I,
actually I take it kind of seriously
but I've been doing so bad.
Next year, I always say this every year, but next year I'm starting over from scratch.
I'm going to go take lessons and everything.
I'm going to do it right, and see if I can actually play this game or not.
Well, that I, I guess that's what I need to do is, is get some kind of lessons or something.
Because I, my, my tee off is not bad,
I mean I'm, I'm good up to everything else putting and stuff like that
it's just, that, that initial tee
Yeah,
what do you do when you're putting?
That's a good thing.
That's something I could learn actually.
That's when I do my worst.
I finally get to the green
and I think I'm doing all, all fine
and then,
Just walking around the hollow and making sure there's not really,
you know, checking the ground and, and so forth, you know.
Yeah.
See how it's going to break or whatever.
Can you really see it though?
Yeah.
What about the speed?
If you get,  if you get down on the ground you really can.
Can you tell but can you tell how, how fast you're going to hit it?
Um, well, if you know if it's up on a slope that you've got to hit it not kill it
but you've got to hit enough speed and the right angle that it's, it's, you know,
because when it's going up a hill it's going to break  in a direction.
Yeah,
but  you can feel that?
Yeah.
I don't know
I have, I can get it within like, you know, four or five feet or something
but I don't have enough field.
Now I'm T V watching.
Yeah.
They  make you die at the hole every time.
Yeah.
Oh, it  just dies and rolls in.
I don't know,
But I,
it's hard for me.
The, the,
it's, it's like I said
once I get up on the green I'm fine,
but that, that tee shot, uh, it, you know,
when teeing off I'll go probably a hundred feet across the ground
so it, it takes me awhile to get to the hole
but,
Once you're there, you're all set though.
I'm all set.
We should play team golf then.
I'll get us there
and you put it in.
that sounds good to me.
I
oh, the T V golfers they do that.
It takes them two to get there and two to get it in
so it's fifty percent.
And me it takes me five to get there and five to get it in.
Well, it, it, it usually takes me about probably two, two or three to get it there
and, and then, that's according to the hole
and it
uh, uh, maybe one or two putts.
It's,  according to  where I'm at on the green.
Yeah.
That's good.
But the friends I play with, uh, they play all the time
and, and they're really good.
Joe Pros?
Uh, they're not Joe Pros
but they, they golf in the high sixties low seventies
so I guess they're pretty good
That's pretty good.
For eighteen?
Yeah.
For eighteen.
Wow,
that's pretty good.
Yeah.
I'm talking to the wrong guy.
Your shitty golf is probably the best golf I've ever seen.
No,
no,
no,
that's not my golf.
That's my friends.
Mine, mine,
I'm, I'm usually in the eighties or nineties
so I'm, I'm not good
If, when I'm in the nineties I'm feeling good.
I'm usually around a hundred.
That's my thing. Around a hundred.
You know, I can hit a great drives and think I'm going to do all awesome on this hole
but it ain't going to happen.
Well, I either, teeing off I either slice it
or I hook it ever single time
and, and I alternate.
Well, it's a good thing with me I slice it every single time.
That's good.
I aim,
