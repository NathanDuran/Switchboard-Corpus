B|if they're going to go out of state for vacation that's the time to go.|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Good idea.|ba
A|Real good idea.|ba
B|Yeah,|b
B|we went up to Wyoming this last, uh, Summer during that time.|sd
B|And it was like you know, eighty degrees up there.|sd
B|It was beautiful.|sd
B|Nice to get out of Texas for a while.|sd
A|We went to Alaska.|sd
B|Well, that's, that's the even, even farther away.|sd
A|That is really nice.|sd
A|It is so cool, you wear a jacket, you know.|sd
B|Even in the Summer time, huh.|bf

B|Uh-huh,|b
B|uh-huh.|b
B|Is that right?|bh
A|Uh, it,|%
A|they call it their liquid gold.|sd
B|Um.|%
A|But it, you know,|%
A|you get sunshine,|sd
A|and it's lovely,|sd
A|and then it rains just enough to keep everything nice and moist and very green. And blooming.|sd
B|Green.|^2
B|Um.|%
A|Oh my goodness, it's pretty.|ba
B|Right.|b
A|Well, Texas isn't bad.|sv
B|No,|aa
B|no.|aa
A|Not in the Spring.|sv
B|Right.|b
B|I have to think every year to try to remember what it was, what's it supposed to like this time of year.|sd
A|Spring is nice.|sv
B|Yeah.|b
B|Because March we usually get a lot of rain, in March, you know.|sd
B|It'll seem the news, the Harold Taft, you know, on the local news.|sd
A|Right.|b
B|March we typically get a lot of rain,|sd
B|and we've had this many inches,|sd
B|and, you know, we're right on target, you know,|sd
B|and just seem like we were getting a lot of rain in March,|sd
B|but I|%
A|Oh, we always we always do though.|sd
B|it's hard to remember twelve months ago what it was like.|sd
B|Yeah|b
A|uh, it,|%
B|I wish, I just wish it wouldn't come all at once|sd
A|That's right,|ba
A|and then we get all that heat.|sd
A|Right.|b
B|Well, it's just that, you know,|sv
B|when it rains, it rains.|sv
B|In California you get these nice, lovely rains, you know, nothing really you know, like downpours like you have here.|sd
B|The other day we had some hail, the biggest hail I've ever seen in Texas.|sd
A|Oh, really.|b
B|Yeah,|b
B|I live in Garland.|sd
A|Oh, you got into that bad stuff.|sv
B|Yeah.|aa
B|We got hail the size of marbles.|sd
B|I mean, just so noisy hitting the house|sd
B|and the glass on the windows.|sd
B|It didn't break anything,|sd
B|but we went out there afterwards|sd
B|and there's ice balls the size of marbles all over our lawn.|sd
A|Isn't that strange.|ba
B|I know, I,|%
B|you pick them up, you know,|sd
B|and they're perfectly round.|sd
B|And I go, gee, how did they form, you know, so perfect like that.|sd
A|I think that's one of the strange, strange things,|sv
A|and you very seldom see it though.|sv
B|Right,|b
B|right.|b
B|I've seen hail, you know,|sd
B|but usually the size, you know, of, uh, tiny, tiny pebbles.|sd
B|You know, really small, you know.|sd
B|But this was, uh, really large.|sd
A|So it had come, it's a drop of water that had come through quite a few rain clouds apparently.|sv
A|Is that correct?|qy
B|Uh, I don't know how hail is formed to tell you the truth.|no
A|I think, I think that's,|sv
B|You don't think it's cold enough, you know to,|sv
A|It's not on the ground,|sd
A|but in the clouds it is.|sd
B|Right,|b
B|must be.|sv
B|I guess,|sv
B|and then, I think, you know, all that falling would warm it up and melt it,|sv
B|but maybe that's what rounds it, I don't know. But, tumbling.|sv
A|I was dumb.|sd
A|I was in, um, Florida for a week on business.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And I had called back to the house.|sd
A|I stayed the weekend,|sd
A|and I called back to the house.|sd
A|My housekeeper was baby-sitting my cats and dogs, pitched said something to the effect of, now we've made the national news, don't get upset, and don't worry,|sd
A|it's in Garland where all the bad weather is.|sd
A|I said, Okay, you know|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and I watched the news,|sd
A|and I thought, ha ha, that's Garland, that's not Plano,|sd
A|I don't have anything to worry about.|sd
A|I was on the plane heading back to Dallas before it dawned on me, stupid, you own property in Garland|sd
A|Felt so dumb.|sd
B|Um.|%
A|Finally I got home and found out my property was okay.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|There was no problem with it.|sd
A|But I guess you just tend to think of, of where your house is you know, and nothing else.|sv
B|Right.|b
B|Right,|b
B|and close to that, what's called Duck Creek that runs through part of Garland, that's the part that always seems to get hardest hit when there's, there's the hard rain.|sd
A|Oh, oh, I see.|b
B|The creek overflows|sd
B|and a lot of houses, a lot of houses around that creek seem to, to get flooded|sd
A|Oh, okay.|b
B|the streets and stuff around that area,  get a lot of flooding.|sd
A|The house, that house,  that I bought is close to a Firewheel golf course.|sd
B|Okay.|b
A|Just going to be blocks off of that new highway one ninety that's going through.|sd
B|Right.|b
B|That's where I live, close to that.|sd
A|Oh really.|b
B|Yeah,|b
B|uh, uh, not quite,|sd
B|I don't live in that Firewheel division.|sd
B|But I live close by there in north, far north Garland.|sd
A|Is that a nice area?|qy
B|Yeah|ny
B|they're supposed to,|sd
B|it's getting built up, you know, with more new, new shopping centers and things. You know,|sd
B|it's a fairly new area.|sd
B|Yeah|%
B|and, uh, and they're supposed to be building a mall somewhere close by, by the next, by ninety-three or ninety-four or something,|sd
B|a brand new mall not too far away from that area,|sd
A|Well,|%
B|so.|%
A|The house that the house that I bought was really, really nice.|sd
B|It'd be nice.|ba
B|Uh-huh,|b
B|in the Firewheel Estates there, whatever.|qy^d
A|Yes,|ny
A|yes.|ny
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|Really, really nice home, very pretty. Uh.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|But you're not living there right now.|qy^d
A|No,|nn
A|I'm going to lease it.|sd
B|Oh, I see.|bk
A|It's, it's investment property.|sd
B|I see.|b
A|But it is really, it's a very nice place.|sd
A|Uh, I, I would cheerfully live there.|sd
A|Of course it's not my home,|sd
A|and I've lived in my home in, well, almost ten years,|sd
A|and, you know, I've got everything just exactly like I want it.|sd
B|Right.|b
A|But if I were to live some place else, it certainly meets my standards.|sd
A|It's a nice house.|sd
B|Uh-huh,|b
B|yeah,|b
B|that's a nice area.|sd
B|Is it on the golf course?|qy
A|No,|nn
A|it's not,|sd
A|it's off the golf course,|sd
A|and I'll be honest with you,|sd
A|I'm going to have to get a map to figure out exactly where is the golf course versus where my house is.|sd
B|Is that right.|b
A|But it's in the estates that adjoin it.|sd
B|Yeah,|b
B|right,|b
B|right.|b
B|Well that's a nice area.|sd
A|Yes,|aa
A|it is.|sd
B|That really is a nice area.|sd
B|When they get that highway finished, you can hop on that and get anywhere you need to go fairly quick.|sd
A|Yeah,|b
A|that one nine that one ninety is just going to be the the outermost loop around.|sd
B|Right,|b
B|another belt line, just, uh, farther out.|sd
A|Right,|b
A|just continue to do that.|sd
B|Right,|b
B|right,|b

A|I've been through all of that.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|Uh, there is an area beyond Thousand Oaks, north of Los Angeles that is really an eerie, strange looking area with boulders,|sd
A|I|%
A|they're not really hills,|sd
A|they're more like just huge boulders with very little vegetation.|sd
B|Huh.|b
B|I'm not familiar with what,|sd
B|is it along the coast or or inland.|qy
A|Uh. Well, you know, it may be a little bit more inland.|sd

B|Um.|%
A|Uh, I had to go up to T I on business a couple years ago|sd
B|Out there,|^2
B|uh-huh.|b

B|I didn't, I don't remember seeing that part of it.|sd
B|I know Valley,|sd
B|yeah,|%
B|it's just a suburb of L A.|sd
A|Right.|b
A|It's a,|%
B|And they've built some new highways out to that area, and things, lately.|sd
B|People can get in and out of L A easier.|sd
A|Maybe it's a place I went to,|sd
A|it was far extreme, thought we'd never find the place.|sd
B|Huh.|b
A|It was interesting. Because we went out the Ventura highway to Thousand Oaks and on up through that way.|sd
B|Yeah,|b
B|sounds interesting.|ba
B|Right.|b
B|Right,|b
B|right.|b
B|I, I know exactly that area.|h

B|I love Thousand Oaks.|sd
B|Uh, Texas, I don't know,|h
B|thing, things,|%

A|Oh, it's green sometime.|sd
B|Yeah,|b
B|but it's just, you know,|%
B|I don't know.|h
A|Well, it doesn't stay green, you know|sd
B|Right.|b
A|the really,|%
A|and in all honesty,|sd
A|I know this sounds like a Texas story,|sd
A|all honesty, you haven't seen the hottest of summers if you've only been here five years.|sd
A|We haven't had a really bad one,|sd
B|Yeah|b
B|I missed that one of eighty or eighty-two or eighty-one that had the heat wave.|sd
A|Oh.|b
A|It may be eighty-two, because we bought our house in eighty-one|sd
A|and we built a pool in eighty-two,|sd
