B|uh, well, I'll tell you,|sd
B|I've been around for quite a few years and worked for a lot of different companies,|sd
B|and, uh, it's hard to beat any of the benefits that, or salaries either,  that we get from T I.|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|I'm quite pleased with it.|sd
B|Course there's a few things that, uh, I think I could do better if I was sitting up in the C E O's seat|sv
B|but, uh I think Jerry's doing a pretty good job as it goes.|sv
A|Oh, yeah.|b
A|The one,|%
A|it's kind of like, uh,|%
A|automobile insurance,|sd
A|the ones, uh, that I think are the highest and important to me, uh, I hope I never have to use them, really per se, although I've used medical a little bit|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|that, well that one certainly is high,|sv
A|I, I worry that it's weakening rather than strengthening|sd
A|so I like to reverse that trend and say I'd like to get those to strengthen, you know,  be better and better.|sd
B|Well,|%
A|Then salary continuance, I've never used that one.|sd
A|I hope I never will,|sd
A|but that's kind of like an insurance thing.|sd
A|I sure like that one.|sv
B|Oh, yes.|b
A|That's like automobile insurance.|sv
A|You never want to get in an accident|sv
A|but it,|%
A|you like to have it there.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Well, uh, like I say, I worked for several different companies|sd

A|Right.|b
A|With T I, or somebody else?|qy
B|No,|nn
B|with T I.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|But I say, I wasn't connected with G S I.|sd
A|Oh, right,|b
A|yeah.|b
B|And, I got caught up in a layoff.|sd
A|Um.|%
B|Now, uh, course you get six months, uh, unemployment from the State|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|but, what T I did for us is, is, uh, I've never heard of it before. They fixed us up with an office with, uh, telephones, access to long-distance, uh, computers, a secretary to take messages for us or type, uh, letters,  for us.|sd
A|Right.|b
B|Uh, they had out of town newspapers|sd
B|and then,|%

B|They did have, uh, seminars every once in a while.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|Uh, course that was not, uh, restricted just to just us.|sd
A|Right.|b
B|But the most important thing was that, uh, they had made up the difference between, uh, unemployment pay and seventy-five percent of my net pay.|sd
B|And they then,|%
B|T I paid me that.|sd
A|Oh, really?|bh
B|So, uh, I was able to, uh, not just exist.|sd
B|I mean, I, I lived just as comfortably as I did before I was laid off.|sd
A|Yeah,|b
A|they seem to be doing a good job of that.|sv
A|I'm in facilities,|sd
A|and our organization built, builds those facilities over in Park Central now.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And I guess they've been using them for six months now.|sd

A|and they said it's like getting a Ph D almost,|sd
A|they,|%
A|the much they learn over there, you know, after they've been laid off, uh,|sd
A|one engineer said it was really an education.|sd
A|He, he just learned, like you,|sd
A|he said he learned a tremendous amount that he never would have able to pick up on his own.|sd
A|He was very thankful for that, too.|sd
B|Well, this was not a learning thing by any means.|sd
B|It was just a, uh,  an assistance trying to find another job.|sd
A|To have an office,|^2
A|yeah.|b
A|Yeah.|b
A|Well, he said he learned so much|sd
A|and how,|%
A|he thought, he thought he had a Ph D in how to get a job after he was,  through the whole process,  for, for several months.|sd
B|Oh.|b
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|He did eventually get a job.|sd
B|Well, course I went through this, uh, what, about five years ago.|sd
B|They may have improved it considerably.|sd
A|Yeah, apparently.|b
A|It's very sophisticated.|sv
A|And I guess it may be one of the best, uh, that anyone's doing.|sv
B|Well, that's one of those little, uh, uh, little extras that you don't see in the, uh, the, the, the handbook, you know.|sd
A|Right.|b
A|You're absolutely right.|ba
A|That's a good one.|ba
B|It,|%

A|Anything on that or,|%
B|Well, now I have, uh, uh,|%
B|I'm getting close to retirement.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|And, of course I've been looking into it but, uh, since I'm only a yellow badger,  I won't be getting a whole heck of a lot from T I,  as far as retirement is concerned.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Right.|b
A|What do you think of a pension that goes from one company to the other like an account like a four O one account.|qo
A|I, I've been thinking about that for years, uh,|sd
B|I've never heard of such a thing.|sd
A|I know.|sd
A|That's what I'm saying that, that pensions,|sd
A|you see, just like you were, you're saying, you've only got, uh, so many years, And then just add the money together like you do with a four O one account, you know.|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Uh, yeah.|b
A|Uh, it's your account, period.|sd
A|It doesn't matter where you go or anything.|sd
A|That's your account to roll over.|sd
B|I,|%
B|that, that sounds like a hell of an idea.|sd
B|I didn't know there was such a thing.|sd
A|No,|ar
A|no|ar
A|there isn't.|sd
A|I, I'm saying that's the question.|sd
A|What do you think could be better|^q
A|and I'm saying that pensions, say in the year two thousand or more when social security goes away, which it probably will,|sv
A|I think they ought to have a pension at least that you'd never lose.|sv
A|So you work for a company seven years,|sd
B|Yes,|b
B|by all means.|ba
B|Well, what would be the difference between that and social security?|qw
A|Uh, well social security's going to go to way, I think|sv
A|and you can, or you can invest your own money.|sd
A|You have no control over your social security.|sv
A|And it's not paid for by the current,|sv
A|like when,|%
A|say we retire after the year two thousand, social security's paid for by the twenty-five year olds.|sv
A|it's there.|sv
B|Yeah,|b
B|yeah.|b
A|You don't have to depend on anybody to be putting that money in for you, you know.|sv
A|That's just a thought.|sd
A|I mean, I,|%
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|if they say which,|%
B|No,|aa
B|I, I like the idea.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|Course, that's, that's, something like an I R A|sd
A|Yeah,|aa
A|and instead of having a, a socialized pension, it just would be really money that you and your company,|sv
A|maybe you had to put some money in it, too,|sv
A|I don't really know.|h
A|But I,  I can see where they'd need to do something on that because the statistics are,|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|you don't work for a company twenty years through no fault of your own, you know.|sv
A|You work for five, six, seven,|sv
A|and|%
A|a lot of people I know, guys,|sd
B|Yeah,|b
B|that, that's what I've done.|sd
B|I, I've bounced around.|sd
B|About every ten years,  I change.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
A|I have, too,|sd
A|but not, not quite that often|sd
A|but, uh, yeah,|%
A|I've only got, uh, I've got, I guess fourteen now here at T I,|sd
A|and I hope to make twenty-five which|sd
A|say if something happened to me,|sd
A|I mean, you know, they lay me off,|sd
A|so, you have a pension|sd
A|but then you'd have to try to get a pension in another one.|sd
A|It would be nice if they could get them together.|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|I do worry about medical, though.|sd
A|Again, knock wood that, uh, I haven't used it.|sd
A|I guess you,|sv
A|I'm sorry,|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc

A|I haven't,|%
A|I can't complain about it because I haven't used it|sd
A|and every time I needed it, it, it, it's, uh, you know,  fallen right in line for the, the, minor things|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|I guess I'm the one just supporting most of the others.|sd
B|Well, doesn't it work, you don't see, uh, uh, anything until you spend the minimum?|qy
A|Uh,|%
B|Don't you have to spend the minimum of two, three hundred?|qy
A|yeah,|ny
A|yeah,|ny
A|I think it's two seventy-five for a family|sd

A|Yeah,|b
A|right.|b
B|I pay a straight five dollars for anything, a doctor visit or drugs|sd
A|Well, drugs are okay,|sd
A|now, I'm on that, uh, plan, where I take blood pressure medicine.|sd
A|If you take an allergy medicine, so, anything you need a prescription for, for more than six months, you get it for, used to be six bucks,|sd

A|You turn,|%
A|you get your doctor to give you a more than six months prescription|sd
A|and, uh, they're twelve dollars,|sd
A|again, they just were six,|sd
A|they just raised them to twelve this year. Twelve dollars for a three months supply. Or whatever, whatever the, the amount is, uh.|sd
B|Um.|%
A|I don't want to say three months,|sd
A|but it's a lot cheaper,|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|allergy medicine's really, uh, expensive|sd
A|and that blood pressure medicine is fairly expensive.|sd
A|I take two.|sd
