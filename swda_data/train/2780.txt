A|Yeah,|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
A|I think, um, this is a tough subject because, uh, when you come from two different parts of the country, uh, the political views are really different.|sv
A|I, uh, I, I guess I've had to discuss a number of what might be considered controversial issues,|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|I guess like, like they're nothing, I guess, nothing is as awful as abortion|sv
A|but like gun control and, uh, day care an things like that,|sv
A|and there are some very different views, uh, of the people connected with the program which I thought was really interesting, you know.|sd
B|Well, now you, you say two different parts of the country|sd
B|what, are, are, are you referring to yourself|qy
B|or,|%
A|Yeah,|ny
A|well being in, in Baltimore see,|sd
A|Maryland is, um, is sort of, um, is as, as a hub of liberalism  you know, compared to the country, uh,|sv
A|you know, very, uh, in, in many ways, uh, very liberal|sd
A|very somewhat to New England|sv
A|though Pennsylvania and New York, uh, I, aren't actually as liberal,|sv
A|Maryland is a very liberal, uh, state|sd
A|so, so, where here we have, um, we have gun control laws|sd
A|we probably have some of the strictest gun control laws in the nation|sv
A|and most people in Maryland vote for that, you know.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|So, it really is a different, um,|sv
B|Uh, well, of course, you talk gun controls down here in Texas|sd
B|and you're asking to be lynched.|sd
A|Yeah,|aa
A|that's, that's right talk to,|aa
A|I had to talk about gun control with somebody|sd
A|and I talked with a woman who actually, you know, had just purchased a gun that day,  and was going target shooting, you know,|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and it was very different|sd
A|it was a whole,  different view.|sd
A|It's really, um, this has opened my eyes to thinking, you know,|sd
A|at one time I just sat here and thought, well, how can anybody believe that|sd
A|because I'd really never met people that did,|sd
A|and now, I talk to people that do.|sd
A|So that's, it's really interesting.|sv
B|Well, it's very true,|aa
B|now I'm a, uh, New Yorker by birth.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|Although I claim Florida as my home now, uh,|sd
B|I have two sons living down there|sd
B|but I also have two sons living elsewhere,  one in Tennessee, one in Mississippi.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|But I lived in in Florida for ten years|sd
B|and I kind of like it down there,|sd
B|but they had a gun control law which went a little bit too far.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|I think uh,|%
B|well in your words, they were a little bit too liberal.|sd
A|Yeah,|b
A|isn't it funny.|qh
B|I mean they they I believe if I'm correct I believe they permitted their carrying concealed weapons.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|But they uh quickly did away with it.|sd
A|Uh.|b
A|Yeah.|b
B|I think in the next session they they uh modified it|sd
B|but it's still legal to own or possess weapons in uh uh Florida.|sd
A|Yeah|b
A|well you can possess 'em here too|sd
A|but They have to be they're registered|sd
A|and Uh, like uh the the Brady Bill that's currently being discussed nationally and whatever is very well supported here, in gun control avenues,|sd
B|The the one week uh seven day the delay|sd
A|You have the seven day waiting period.|qy^d
B|Uh huh.|ny
A|Yeah|b
B|Well I don't mind that too much|sd
A|that's uh that's|%
B|I'm I'm with the N R A myself.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|And uh, uh Really the only objection we have Is uh you you give a little|sv
B|and next thing you know somebody's trying to take more.|sv
A|Yeah|aa
A|that's true|aa
A|that's very true|aa
A|That's and that's the way I guess most of the um the political organizations work you know|sv
A|the same I know the abortion issue with right to life and right to choose|sv
B|Yeah.|b
A|and and both of them are both want the extent of extremes so that they don't give anything for a balance you know|sv
A|there's there's always that difficulty|sv
B|Well then tell me|ad
B|do you consider yourself a liberal?|qy
A|Um I would say I'm probably liberal|na
A|yeah|ny
B|Well let me ask you this then.|ad
A|yeah|b
A|Sure|aa
B|How is your what is your feeling about uh uh expressing yourself by burning the American flag?|qo
A|Well I'll tell you.|^h
A|I I think you know if they if they didn't give as much coverage to these idiots that burn the flag, it would never happen|sv
A|do you know what I mean?|qh
B|Huh.|b
A|It's only because they make a big stink over it.|sv
A|But I I guess actually I believe that if somebody wants to burn the flag I guess that's their opportunity|sv
A|They're they're they're right in the sense of freedom of speech|sv
A|But I would never|sd
B|Well now wait a minute there|ad
A|Yeah.|aa
B|you just said it.|sd
B|It's their right by freedom of speech?|qy
B|What does speech have to do with burning a flag?|qw
A|Yeah.|b
A|Well it's|%
A|that they|%
A|I think the idea of freedom of speech goes back to|sv
A|and I uh uh the the the whole aspect of being able to display your uh your ideas you know|sv
A|the what the country stands on America stands on is that they can do that Uh,|sv
A|though I would never even consider it in a million years to do it myself|sd
A|I I I think uh you know|sv
A|but I I still|%
A|what the flag stands for I guess to me is that if somebody wants to voice their opinion or display their opinion openly and if that is a a way that they can show their opinion then they should be allowed|sv
A|uh|b
B|Now uh Well I I still go back to ...|%
A|Unless the burn unless the actual fire hinders somebody's health and well-being you know|sd
A|but I I think that's I guess that's I that's my opinion|sd
A|Yeah|%
A|I guess you feel differently.|qy^d
B|Then would you condone the burning of the capitol building?|qy
A|Uh, no|nn
A|but I think that's that's uh it's that's taxpayer's money.|sv
A|If somebody buys their own flag and and burns it that's fine|sv
A|but that that's you know that's destruction and of uh public property and whatever.|sv
B|Uh, then you don't draw a line between public property and uh uh uh what a public uh symbol.|bf
A|No|aa
A|I don't know|no
A|I guess the symbolism|%
A|oh I think what America stands for is the right to be able to disagree with the government.|sv
B|Uh yeah|b
A|Uh I think that's what's made democracy|sv
B|but here again I go back to the second amendment|sd
B|You can disagree by freedom of speech which, has nothing to do with action.|sv
A|Yeah.|b
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Yeah.|b
A|Well that's that's true|aa
B|Now I am I am adamantly against that.|sd
A|Yeah|b
A|But I think I I|%
A|Yeah|b
A|I I I guess the idea you know they always keep saying like the framers.|sd
A|Um. there uh one of the Republican the appointees for the the judicial bench|sd
A|and they always talk about they feel that this person believes in the framing of the constitution what the original framers the ideals the original framers set down.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And Um I believe that the idea of burning the flag is is in|sv
B|huh.|b
A|my understanding of how it was framed is that you this the thing about this country is that you can disagree with its government|sd
A|and you can display that.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|Uh, I Yeah,|%
A|I|%
A|and and so that as a freedom of expression and speech and whatever I I think that that's viable.|sv
A|Um as long as it's your flag and and you've made your your point. I think.|sv
A|Yeah|%
A|Because, realistically, like for you for you you don't think it's right|qy^d
B|No.|nn
A|And I would never do it.|sd
A|I I love this country too much,|sd
A|and that symbol means a lot to me.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|Um. But I guess it's just one of those things where if they if that's what's something it's a need for them you know.|sv
B|Well here again we uh|%
B|even though you uh physically you agree with me you you wouldn't do it yourself.|bf
A|Yeah.|b
A|Yes.|b
A|No.|aa
B|Nevertheless you maintain that it's it is the right of of any citizen to burn the symbol of their country.|bf
A|Right.|aa
A|Yeah.|aa
A|Uh huh.|aa
B|Uh, um so long as it's their possession.|bf
B|Ok, you're you're that's fine up to there except that uh, what that flag symbolizes is uh uh is this country,|aap_am
A|Uh huh.|b
B|and I used to know as a Boy Scout|sd
B|but all I remember was the red in the flag represented the blood that was shed to to create this country, and to maintain it.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|And, to me that's uh uh black eye to every man that ever uh carried a weapon or killed for his country.|sv
A|I agree there too.|aa
A|I agree with you there too.|aa
A|I I the um I I it's I find it you know personally disgusting|sd
A|But I don't think that I don't think that uh we have a right to stop somebody from that you know|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|the same I don't know|%
A|I guess I get I get uh all mixed up inside. when, Yeah|sd
B|It's It's very easy to do.|sv
A|it when it's uh it's an emotional issue,|sv
A|and you sit|sv
A|and you try and think about it logically|sv
A|and and and you know you try to say to yourself now emotionally this is a disgusting thing,|sv
A|uh but logically um|%
A|even you know for instance, the pro life pro choice movement, uh you know|sd
A|I don't know anybody that actually supports abortion,|sd
A|but they would vote pro choice.|sd
B|Uh|b
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|because you know That's just a disgusting thing you know|sv
A|somebody|%
A|an abortion means it's somebody's in trouble and that it's an awful thing, you know|sv
B|Well I think it should be permitted under certain|sv
A|but|%
A|Yeah.|b
A|but it that's uh that's what I mean,|sd
A|see,|%
A|but but realistically when you think of it it just sounds like such an awful thing,|sv
A|and it evokes an emotional response.|sv
A|I think that's the hardest thing,|sv
A|I don't know if I could ever be a judge, because some things emotionally just aren't you know|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Huh.|b
B|Well tell me|ad
B|has it ever been decided when when is a uh fetus a human?|qy
A|No,|nn
A|no|nn
A|I think the um|%
A|sometimes I guess|%
A|what did I read recently|t1
A|the um the uh Christian uh point is is always the point of well it's at conception|sd
A|but then um a friend of mine's a doctor and argues with others that conception is a biblical term.|sd
A|And there's no concept of conception in medicine or biology.|sd
B|Huh.|b
A|so then that so that throws out that idea makes it a religious discussion then.|sd
A|So it's|%
A|I don't know.|no
A|It's very it's it's uh you know It's a it's a topsy-turvy world|sv
A|and it's really something how um political ideas and viewpoints within one country can vary so much and also within um within a,|sv
B|Or they|%
B|on their within the own uh society, it can vary.|^2
A|Yeah|b
A|and how Yeah|%
