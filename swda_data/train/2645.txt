A|Oh, yes.|bk
B|It, uh, unfortunately I guess for myself it wasn't, uh, it was purely by my own choice.|sd

B|it's getting better all the time,|sd
B|I knew it would be different from the very beginning,|sd

B|so I was in the computer operations|sd
B|it's, uh, you know, it all starts to become similar|sd
B|there's, you know, there's benefits|sd

A|or I,  I'm significantly shaken by the situation,  but not devastated.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Right.|b
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Well, the one thing I guess at least in your favor is the, the fact that, that is more in the support of the manufacturing|sv
B|and there's lots and lots of companies that have maybe not in the the defense area but manufacturing in general.|sv
A|To tell you the truth, I'm, I'm, I'm not really worried.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|That's great.|ba

B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Sure,|b
B|yeah.|b

B|and they're just,|%
B|actually, what the positions that they found outside of the company were much, much better than the ones that they currently had inside.|sv
A|So, despite the fact that I should be tying flies or fly fishing or, or going for walks in the mountains,  I can't seem to get into it right now.|sd
B|Exactly.|ba
B|Uh-huh,|b
B|well, I'm sure it's just with the, the, the, the way that things are so topsy-turvy right now as soon as you decide on a pass ,|sv

B|pick out where you want to live,|ad
B|and then once you pick that spot out, pick out what you want to do.|ad
A|I see that's the problem.|sd
A|For the last many years I've more or less let them direct what I want to do,  and where I want to go. And just kind of go with the punches.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Sure.|ba
A|And now I feel lost.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Yeah,|b
B|that's a,|%

A|Oh, I had job offers.|no
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|But, I never found the one that was worth it for me to leave.|sd
A|And that,|%
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Well, the best thing about it is that you can, uh, try something|sv
B|if you don't like it, shoot, move on to something else.|ad
B|That's the way I would have looked at the whole thing here,|sd
B|I'll take a chance,|sd
B|if I don't like it, I'll go someplace else, do something different.|sd

B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And I'm looking at it as, as an adventure.|sd
B|Right,|ba
B|there you go.|ba
B|That's the way to do it.|ba
A|And maybe I'll wet a fly line this year and do some camping if I don't get laid off between now and then.|sd
B|There you go,|ba
B|that's the thing to do.|ba
B|That's much funner than doing any kind of job.|ba
