A|How do you feel about gun control?|qo
B|Well, uh, I mean I don't think that guns should be outlawed|sv
A|Um.|b
B|but it's going to,|%
B|a lot of the stuff that,|%
B|I mean all you do is to get guns and then like with the stuff of that massacre in Killeen, Texas not too long ago, But I don't really know, I mean, unless they do, uh, just outlaw them, how you can, uh, prevent that.|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Well, don't you think that you know, just having, you know, some, you know almost like a driver's license be required you know with stiff penalties if you are found with, with you know a gun that is not registered or you know that you are not licensed to carry.|qy
B|Yeah,|ny
B|that,|%
B|well do you even know what the procedures are now?|qy
B|Um.|b
A|There is no national,|sd
B|But, it's kind of like if you want a gun you can get a gun, especially if you have the money to pay for it.|sv
A|Uh, in most States as long as you aren't a convicted felon. You know or on probation or, uh, you know, other obvious things like that.|sv
B|Yeah.|b
A|Uh, and I know, I know that like in a lot of states you could, you could be just like released from a mental hospital the day before. You know, be, be obviously insane,|sd
A|and then, you, you know but have your legal right to get a gun.|sd
B|Huh. I didn't know that.|sd
B|Well, that's pretty scary.|ba
B|So, does, now do they want us to say where we feel about it, like in rating it one to ten.|qy
A|Uh, yeah,|ny
A|I'd probably, I'd probably say about a five.|sd
B|That's where I would probably be|sd
A|Seems like it's a good safe number to pick, you know.|sv
B|Well, I mean, I mean I don't really know what they can, how they can really enforce the laws any better|sd
A|Uh-huh|b
B|because I mean I do think that some people need them and, like, for protection and stuff|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and I can understand them wanting to have them,|sd
B|but then again it's just like all those nuts out there.|sv
A|Well, you know, uh, uh,|%
A|if you are looking at like you know country that, uh, where they do have a lot more gun control, like England and places like that, you know|sv
A|the amount of violent crime has decreased by so much.|sv
B|It has?|bh
B|Because then,|%
A|Well I mean yeah.|ny
A|The, uh, the|%
A|in comparing per capita murders are incredibly lower than the United States.|sv
B|Um.|b
A|Uh, you know, I mean, the problem though, you know, they, if the, since the United States had this, you know, pretty much unrestricted flow of guns going for so long that I think, you know, if you were introduced, you know, any controls, it would probably take a long while for them to take effect just because there is a glut of guns out there already.|sv
B|Yeah.|b
A|You know, so it's, it's really kind of a complex problem.|sv
B|Well, is the crime that bad there in Atlanta?|qy
A|Uh, I'm not really sure how bad it is.|no
A|I've, I've not really had that many problems with it,|sd
A|but I mean apparently we, we were ranked pretty high up.|sd
B|Yeah|b
B|I know Dallas is.|sd
A|Uh. I mean, I think, you know, in the|%
A|I mean I think we have been like ranked in one of the top three for murders in the last few years.|sd
B|I don't know if Dallas is in the top three|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|but. Do you own a gun?|qy
A|No.|nn
A|I've thought about getting one.|sd
A|If I get one, I think I will probably, you know, get something.|sd
A|I probably wouldn't get a hand gun.|sd
A|I would probably get like a shotgun.|sd
A|Just for protecting myself. You know, from burglar type thing.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|I do kind of live in the downtown area.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|You know and shotguns are really good because they're,|sv
A|I mean somebody is not going to break in, steal it, and you know, use it to mug someone, you know.|sv
B|That's true.|aa
A|Uh, and you know, you,|%
A|yeah,|%
A|I just don't understand these people, you know, like when they, they decide they're going to buy a gun to protect themselves.|sd
A|They go out and buy a three fifty seven magnum which is going to shoot through you know,|sv
A|they are probably going to miss the person|sv
A|and, and they're going to shoot through five wall, and hit someone, you know.|sv
A|I mean a shotgun just really struck me as being you know a real good defensive weapon.|sv
A|You can sort of point it somewhere in the direction of you know whoever.|sv
B|Yeah.|b
A|You pretty much stop them.|sv
A|And, you don't,|%
A|then the actual shot doesn't go that far, you know, a wall will stop it pretty much.|sv
B|and, uh, my Dad gave me a gun|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|but I never did go out and practice with it enough to feel comfortable with it|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|so I finally ended up giving it back to him.|sd
B|I said I don't want it.|sd
B|I don't want to be responsible for it because you know if you're not going to teach me how to do it and if I am not going to, you know, be responsible enough to go out and learn, I don't need it.|^q
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Yeah,|b
A|that, that really does scare me. People, you know, that have guns|sd
A|because you know, if you ever get in the situation where you know you are not prepared to shoot,|sv
A|but you pick up the gun and point it at the person that, that person rushes you.|sv
B|Yeah.|b
B|And they get it from you.|sv
A|And you know, you're pretty much dead you know.  Because you, you've just told the person that you, you're about to kill them then, You know|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Set them off.|^2
A|and, and, well I mean, you, you basically made it clear to the person that you know unless he, unless, you know that you are a real danger to them|sv
A|and then you know if you, if they manage to get the gun from you, you know their first reaction is going to be you know, stop you.|sv
B|Yeah,|aa
B|well that's why I ended up giving it back to him.|sd
B|I thought well you know. I don't want it if I don't know how to you know, if I don't really know how to use it|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and I just didn't want the responsibility.|sd
A|Um.|b
B|So. Well, uh, did you hear about that Killeen massacre or whatever?|qy
A|Yeah,|ny
A|the, did it happen at a cafeteria or something?|qy
B|Yeah,|ny
B|right.|na
B|That kind of I mean it just makes you wonder how people get guns.|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|I would be scared selling guns to people.|sd
