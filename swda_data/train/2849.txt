A|Okay,|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
A|well, I|%
A|I mean, what thoughts do you have on the subject?|qo
B|Uh, you know, we even lived there for a, a while when my husband was in the Navy.|sd
A|Oh, you did?|qy^d
B|In fact the first year we were married, he was already over there, had been there two years when we got married|sd
B|and so our,  we had a one year honeymoon.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|Uh, Uh, it was very nice, um.|sv
A|That's wonderful.|ba
A|Well do you have, you probably have a different sense than I have.|sv
A|I went to an inner city high school in Chicago.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|Um, and that's not where I am originally from.|sd
A|It was a divorce situation of my parents.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And it was a, a cultural shock to me.  Uh, in terms of what I went through.|sd
B|I'm sure.|ba
A|The high school is now called, in fact, it was called Tulley High School|sd
A|and now it's called Roberto Clemente|sd
B|Roberto died while we were down there as a matter of fact.|sd
A|That, yeah, that's exactly, about twenty years now.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|Uh, what was it like living there,|qo
A|I mean did you find that people appreciated having the privilege of being,|qy
B|It's like anywhere else.|sv
B|People are individuals|sv
B|and I find it really difficult an, and, frustrated trying to make stereotypes, you know.|sd
A|Right,|aa
A|I agree with that,|sd
A|yeah.|%
B|And, uh, I can understand the, the frustration you must have gone through, uh, going to the, the school, uh.|sd
A|I didn't mean that in a totally negative sense.|sd
B|No,|aa
B|no,|aa
B|it's just,|%
B|if, if it's not part of your culture,  and you come upon something that you're totally unprepared for,  uh, the|sd
A|Right.|b
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|I had gone to a very, uh, uh, um, conservative, uh, college|sd
B|and when I started teaching school it was in an inner city situation,  although it was not Puerto Rican, it was, uh, a Mexican American and black students.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|They weren't like any of the Mexican American or black people I had gone to school with|sd
B|so it was,  it was very, very, different.|sd
A|Right,|b
A|that you had ever been.|bf
A|Right,|b
A|I mean, I'll give you and idea that I had, um,|sd
A|and I would say, I would say the ones, the majority appreciated what they were having in this country.|sv
B|Yeah.|b
A|Uh, but a lot of the ones that didn't even in the minority, not in the sense of the cultural world, word, they made it worse for the other kids in school.|sd
A|And, you know, Chicago, back then, even had bilingual classes.|sd
B|Oh, really.|bh
A|Yeah,|ny
A|and I mean, I had geometry,|sd
A|the teacher was from Cypress Greece|sd
A|and,  it was, Spanish and English,|sd
B|Huh.|%
A|so if you can imagine how I even|sd
B|Oh, my.|ba
A|And, I mean, and I guess I look at is as an enlightening sense.|sv
B|Yeah.|b
A|Um, but I think basically, I think they should leave things the way they are right now,|sv
A|I mean, I don't really have enough in terms of an argument, pro or con in terms of making any type of change.|sd
B|I'm not, so much against their making, uh, it a state.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|But I would want a very, very, very clear majority,|sd
B|because if the minority can be so, vociferous, whether you're talking this group, or, or,  any other group that, that has a stake in something.|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Right,|aa
A|that's exactly.|aa
B|And they can make, as you said, uh, so well, the, a, a few can make it so miserable for everybody else.|sv
A|And that's exactly,|aa
A|I mean, I can remember instances that, uh, wasn't as, uh, you know, bad,|sd
A|Lord, I don't know how it would be today.|h
A|Well I know what it looks like,|sd
A|I've been back up for a reunion.|sd
B|That, that my give you a clue.|sv
A|It does,|sd
A|yeah,|aa
A|um, but its', but it's an experience I wouldn't change,|sd
A|I mean my husband, um, grew up in, um, a majority, uh, WASP, southern Ohio, you know.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|So that, um,|%
A|when he saw where I, you know, saw my later teenage years, he was just, I hate to say aghast, because that sounds so trite,|sd
A|but he was.|sd
A|And yet, how did I turn out the way I did turn out.|qh
B|Yeah,|b
A|And I said that's really irrelevant.|sd
A|What you find is that, um, if you can talk to like,|sv
A|I mean, I learned a lot about the, um, Island of Puerto Rico from talking to these kids.|sd
A|You know, and you lived there|sd
A|so you know that parts of it are beautiful and parts of it are squalor.|sv
B|Same as, as any other part of the world,|sv
A|Like here, yeah,  it's the same.|aa
B|really.|b
B|I, I don't, I don't think it's really to their best interests,  to, uh, uh, attain statehood as it is right now,|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|they have the best of both worlds.|sv
B|They have, uh, representation,|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|but they don't have to pay all the taxes and so forth that we do.|sd
A|This is true.|aa
B|Uh, being that it's an island economy, um,|sd
B|everything is imported|sd
B|and yes, the cost of living is super high,|sv
B|but, but they're protected in so many ways without having to, to pay for the rights and privileges.|sv
A|Uh-huh,|b
A|I know what you're saying,|sd
A|yeah,|%
B|So, so you know, I, I would just as soon,|sd
B|an, an, and, if, if they voted to, for independence, I would back them a hundred percent.|sd
B|And that's,  that's, because, I, I guess, because I'm not into territorialism or whatever, that we have been in the past.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Right,|aa
A|right,|aa
A|I probably would say the something if I knew that intellectually that it was good|sv
A|and emotionally that the people there wanted it.|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
B|Right.|b
A|You know, it's just, um,|%
A|I mean, right now they have the privilege of voting with the United States, don't they.|qy
B|Yeah,|ny
B|yeah.|ny
A|They count, yeah, as a principle,|sd
A|that's what I thought.|sd
A|Um, but I've also been down there.|sd
A|We traveled a lot to the B V I, the British Virgin Islands.|sd
B|Oh, yes,|b
B|uh-huh.|b
A|So you always pass through San Juan in going to places like or .|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|I, um,|%
A|and it's just, it's, I think what they do need is an infusion of some of the United States, um, privileges, some of our resources. The educational, the teachers, the, um,  academic opportunity, you know,|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|I don't think we do do enough of a resource transfer, if there is such a thing.|sv
B|Part of that though has been, I think, uh, selected by, by them,  in that, that whereas they want the benefits of some of, of what the continentals can offer,|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|they,  they want to maintain that, um, culture of theirs,  which, which I understand.|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Uh,|%
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And, and so often when you, when you bring in the advantages, the resources and so forth, there, there is a trade.|sv
A|They'll lose their ethnicity as they say,|bf
A|yeah.|%
A|That's,|%
B|Most of the people who that that I know about who really, uh, would, favor statehood,  have pretty much assimilated into the, the continental states already.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|See,|%
B|Or they have family here and this way they can go back and forth|sd
B|and, and it's not that much of a strain,|sd
B|and,  you know, they're kind of lackadaisical about it.  At least at the present time.|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|That's the way, the way the pendulum seems to be swinging, right now.|sv
A|It sounds like you probably know|sv
A|I mean to this day are you still in touch with any native Puerto Ricans that you have made friends with,|qy
A|or,|%
B|No,|nn
B|we really didn't keep that up,|sd
B|it's just,|%
A|No,|b
A|that's natural,|sv
A|I just thought I'd ask that because I wondered what you thought they might think.|sd
B|Um.|%
A|Because I really don't have any, um, personal or professional or familial ties down there.|sd
A|I don't know, the the, the, the, that's just children, but the, the people that I went to high school with, um, I think the majority are in that, the, probably the generation, yours and mine|sv
A|and the one right after us, that, um, their parents did not want to acclimate to the United States.  Um, in terms of retaining, um,|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and my background's European heritage|sd
A|and their background it would be, you know, the, I guess I would say the Latin or Latino heritage.|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|Not speaking in English, um, having the children drive them everywhere, and these were not old people.|sd
A|These were like in their early forties.|sd
B|Um.|%
A|Um, and I always, that always bothered me|sd
A|and then there were some children that I noticed as soon as all the kids were out of high school, I mean they went back to Puerto Rico to live.|sd
A|You know, they had made enough money here.|sd
B|And so|%
A|But on the other hand, I guess it's all about choice in everything.|sv
B|Yeah.|b
A|Um, was it,|qy
A|I mean how were they toward,|qo
A|that's interesting the, the way, term you used continentals, which I'm sure is the proper term.|sv
A|How were they toward the United States in terms of just general, relationships,|qo
A|I mean, were they glad?|qy
B|There really were three major, um, camps,|^h
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and there were those who, who, uh, were very friendly, very open, any, anything we can do for you, uh, uh,|sd
B|either way, you know, was great.|sv
B|And then there were those at the other end of the spectrum and those that, ho hum, whatever,  you know,|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|and, and, uh, it, it was interesting,|sv
B|the whole time we were there it was very, very political.|sd
B|There was always some, on Sunday afternoons, uh, going through the, all the little urbanizations, the little neighborhoods with, uh,  blow horns, oh,|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|I can't think of the term|sd
B|but, you know.|%
A|I know what you're talking about|sd
A|yeah.|%
B|And with banners and, and a parade of vehicles with their, with their colors of the,  of a particular party.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|So they were very, very, um, passionate,  about their beliefs|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|but it, it, it kind of broke down that you couldn't really see,|sv
B|I couldn't see that there was a clear majority that, that stayed.|sd
B|It seemed to shift as, as,|sv
A|Yeah,|b
A|I don't, I don't predict,|sd
A|what you're describing is actually a conflict, very|sv
A|hello, uh,|qy
A|you know what,|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
A|I've got to go, because that's my cordless battery going.|sd
B|Oh, oh, I see,|b
