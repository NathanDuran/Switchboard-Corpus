A|Okay.|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
B|Do you want to go first?|qy
A|You can go first,|oo_co_cc
A|or I will.|oo_co_cc
B|Well, you go ahead.|ad
A|Okay.|aa
A|Well, I'm going to tell you what I'd have|sd
A|Down in the south, we have a lot of shrimp,  okay?|sd
B|Oh,|b
B|yeah.|b
A|And I have, uh, shrimp that is steamed in beer, that I cook.|sd
B|Oh, yeah.|b
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And then I have a cauliflower that I would cook, garlic bread, green salad, tea,|sd
A|and we'd have a lemon pie for dessert.|sd
B|Oh, it sounds fantastic.|ba
A|Yes.|aa
A|And what's really neat about it is, the shrimp is cooked in your, uh, like your rice steamer,  your rice cooker.|sd
B|Oh, yeah.|b
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And, um, you place the shrimp in the, in the rice steamer,|ad
A|and you put a bay leaf and put some, uh, red pepper over it.|ad
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|Now, you can either use, you know, the kind that comes in the little can|ad
A|or you can just get some, you know, regular red peppers.|ad
B|Is it cayenne pepper, you mean?|qy
A|Cayenne?|qy
B|Yes.|ny
A|Uh-huh.|ny
B|Uh-huh.|b^m
A|And you put a little bit of that over it.|ad
A|Now if you use the dried kind? Then you would only use two of them.|ad
B|Yes.|b
A|And you put that in there,|ad
A|and then you pour two bottles of beer over it.|ad
B|And how much shrimp would you use?|qw
A|Two pounds.|sd
B|Two pounds,|b^m
B|okay.|bk
A|That's the jumbo shrimp in the shells.|sd
B|Oh, yeah.|b
A|Leave the shells on them so they won't just roll up.|ad
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And you pour the beer over the top of it,|ad
A|and you cover it.|ad
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And you only cook it until the mixture begins to boil,  and the shrimp turn pink.|ad
B|Okay.|aa
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|Then you remove it,|ad
A|and you put it on a platter.|ad
A|And then you serve it with melted butter.|ad
A|And, uh, I usually put garlic powder in mine.|sd
B|Oh, yeah.|b
A|And they can just dip it,|sd
A|and they shell it as they eat it.|sd
B|Sure.|b
A|But, uh, then the uh, the cauliflower, you,  cook that in the microwave.|ad
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And what you do is, you just, uh, wash it,|ad
A|and you core it. And in a like a, oh, what do you call it? Like Pyrex or something like that, kind of bowl that would go in the microwave.|ad
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|A glass dish.|qy^d
A|Uh-huh.|ny
B|Uh-huh.|b^m
A|But it's got to have one that has a cover on it.|sd
B|Okay,|b
B|uh-huh.|b
A|And you, uh, put about two tablespoons of, uh, water into this bowl, and about an eighth a teaspoon of salt.|ad
B|Yeah.|b
A|And then you just set your cauliflower in there,|ad
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and then you cook it for seven minutes on high.|ad
A|And you rotate it one time.|ad
B|And it's, are you cooking the whole head at one time?|qy
A|Uh-huh. Uh, when you core it, you be real careful so you won't knock your flowers off.|ny
B|Okay.|bk
B|I see.|aa
A|And, uh, you just set it in there,|ad
A|and you microwave it on high for seven minutes,|ad
A|and you turn it one time.|ad
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And while that's cooking, I take mayonnaise, about a cup of mayonnaise, and a teaspoon of mustard, and some garlic powder,|sd
A|and I mix it all together.|sd
A|And I shred up some just regular white cheese.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And after that's cooked, you take it out and pour this on top of it,|ad
A|and then you sprinkle the cheese on top of that.|ad
A|And you cook it for another three minutes on high, you know,  just mainly to melt the cheese and everything, and let all the seasoning melt into it.|ad
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And,  it's done.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
B|Oh, that sounds fantastic.|ba
A|It is good.|sd
A|But it, it looks,|%
A|I mean, what you can do then, see is, like what I usually do is, I'll like sit the cauliflower in the middle,|sd
A|and then I put the, uh, shrimp around the outside of it,  you know, on my platter.|sd
B|Um, um.|b
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And then I have a green salad that I put around the outside of that.|sd
A|And, you know, you have all the different seasonings and stuff,|sd
A|and then I just fix little individual cups for them.|sd
A|And they have the,  garlic bread,|sd
B|Sure.|b
A|and it makes it a real nice looking,  you know.|sd
B|And it's  not much work.|sv
A|Huh-uh,|aa
A|huh-uh.|aa
A|But it looks like it, you know|sv
B|That sounds,|%
B|Yeah,|aa
A|You look like you went to a whole bunch,|sd
B|I bet it tastes good too.|qy^d
A|Right.|na
A|And, uh, usually I cut those little cherry tomatoes up,  and put some color into it, you know,|sd
B|Oh, yeah.|b
A|and I'll lay those on top of my salad, you know, to make it look nice and things like that.|sd
B|Now, how many could you serve?|qw
A|Okay.|^h
A|Uh, it usually serves six.|sd
B|Yeah.|bk
B|okay.|bk
B|I figured about that.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|Oh, that's good.|ba
B|See out here, we have so many, uh, ethnic people.|sd
B|We have Italians,|sd
B|and we have Portuguese,|sd
B|and we have Russians and Polish.|sd
B|And it depends, out here, like the type of people you're going to entertain, you know?|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|So it's hard, uh,|sv
B|you, you just have to pick something, for the, the group that you're going to entertain for that particular time.|sv
A|Yeah.|b
B|And, uh, they're big on finger food here, too. You know, chicken wings and, uh, ribs, and that kind of stuff. Uh, barbecue and, uh, cooking out in the yard, it, you know, when it's nice. Barbecue outside, chicken and that kind of stuff.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
A|Yeah.|b
A|Have you ever had crawfish?|qy
B|Uh, no,|nn
B|but I have had shrimp.|sd
A|Oh. You ought to try some crawfish.|ad
A|They are good.|sd
A|But see, that's one good thing about living down here is, usually anybody that comes over, you know, even if it's like, out of town guests and stuff, they want our cooking.|sv
B|Oh, of course.|ba
A|You know,  they want it from down here.|sv
