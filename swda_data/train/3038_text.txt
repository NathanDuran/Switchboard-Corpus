Okay.
Okay.
So tell me about CHINA CRY.
Okay,
CHINA CRY was basically the, the true story written by this, this lady who had, uh, was a native, a native Chinese, uh, uh, who was raised by Christian parents.
Uh-huh.
And her, her time frame was prior to the nineteen forty-nine revolution.
I see.
Although she, herself, had never really accepted Jesus or gone through any of the other, uh, Christian, uh, portions of, of the faith, repentance, baptisms, et cetera, et cetera. She had always felt a very strong, uh, leaning in this direction.
And whenever the cultural revolution of nineteen forty-nine occurred and most churches were either banned or their, all the clergy and so forth were killed or, or imprisoned or, and the property confiscated, she was safe because she had, you know, not officially joined the, the Christian movement.
Uh-huh.
So anyway, she, as she grew up towards maturity, her parents, well,
her dad was a doctor
and, and he was rather well, you know, rather well to do in the old regime
and the, the the the communist Chinese didn't like this at all.
You know, the bourgeoisie was, was, was definitely out of, uh, style, then.
Right.
Everybody was back to a commonality of one.
And so they kept picking at him, picking at his, at her mother and, uh, finally, uh, started picking on her. And getting her to, you know,
Uh-huh.
they were starting to, uh, accuse her of, of, of, uh, crimes and atrocities before the, the revolution and, and had her write her own story over and over and over.
Uh, and the, uh, the major point of the movie was that, that she had, uh, married this, this Chinese fellow and was with child when they started this mass court.
Now, I think I'm leaving out a portion.
She she went through college and graduated very high up in her class and had, uh, gotten a job as, as an instructor
and they had her teaching, or were starting to have her teach history for the soldiers. When the, they decided that, that she needed to start recanting of all of her pre, uh, regime crimes as it were.
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
Being a child, you know.
So, they kept on and on at, at her,
and in the meantime, she and her husband, uh, were were expecting a child, their own child.
And, uh, the, the people kept harassing her over, you know, over a period of months
and finally they, uh, carried her, uh, out into the courtyard to, to, either really to shoot her or to go through the motions of, of shooting her, uh, with by firing, or, you know, executing her by firing squad.
Uh-huh.
And, uh, the Lord just said no,
this is not going to happen even though this lady has not really, you know,
she's, she's one of mine,
she is not going to die
and, uh, the, the soldiers were blinded when they shot.
Huh.
And she, her life was spared.
And this, this frightened the, the, uh, the commandant
and so he called this kind of stuff off and just put her in the labor camp.
Huh.
Well, uh, and, course, here's this, this woman who is heavy with child dragging rocks around.
Huh.
Well she, she put in for going, going to, uh,
and her husband had escaped to Hong Kong, uh,
and then she put in to go see him.
And over time she, uh, uh,
finally, through her perseverance and writing enough letters to enough different people embarrassed enough of the, the middle, uh, bureaucracy that they finally let her go.
Huh.
And, of course, she had to walk.
You know, they, they stripped her of everything, practically besides the, the clothes on her back.
And, uh, so she, so she went across the border to her husband and another, and other child that they'd already had uh, to freedom.
Uh-huh.
Oh.
And they knew that she wasn't going to come back,
but yeah, she did, years later when the, uh, liberalization, you know, in real life liberalization of China happened,
Uh-huh.
and, uh, she was not persecuted or anything else like that.
Huh. Interesting story.
Yes,
it was.
Uh, very moving, too.
I, uh, I don't even remember seeing that advertised
and it was probably here and gone fairly quickly.
Well, it was within, oh, ninety days.
Oh. That recent.
Yeah.
No,
I mean it's, it was, it was advertised over a period of about ninety days.
Oh, I see what you mean.
But it wasn't,
uh, they didn't have it in, uh, too awfully many movie houses,
but it was, it was, in the,
it had large, uh, uh, uh, press release.
Uh-huh.
Well, uh, I guess what I, what I saw most recently and luckily I saw it only a week ago so I'd remember remember it well was, uh, sort of light by comparison.
Okay.
Uh-huh.
Uh, my husband and I had this great desire to go see a comedy
and, and, uh, we ended up going to see GREEN CARD.
GREEN CARD?
GREEN CARD.
Uh-huh.
And, uh, he chose it
and, uh, it's got this wonderful French actor who's,
it was his, like, his,
and he's been a star in France and a wonderful actor who we've enjoyed for years,
but he's never made an American film.
This was his American film debut
Oh, I see,
uh-huh.
and he speaks very broken English.
And basically he played, uh, a Frenchman who married an American girl, uh, in a marriage of convenience so that he could get his green card, which is what an alien needs to work in this country.
Uh-huh.
Right,
uh-huh.
And, uh, because she could claim she was married, she could get, uh, an apartment or a condominium in a very exclusive building in New York that had a garden, an, an, an outside garden, which is very unusual there.
Uh-huh.
So she was a horticulturist,
and that was sort of her dream.
Oh, I see,
uh-huh.
Of course, you know, they got married
and they never saw each other again.
Except, except fate through them together *through threw
and the Immigration and Naturalization Service, uh, started investigating.
So they had to get back together and get their stories straight,
and, and she was a very svelte, sophisticated urban New Yorker
Oh.
and he was a, a poor Frenchman who had grown up on the, on the streets and sort of pulled himself up by his bootstraps and claimed to be a composer,
but there was no proof whatsoever that he really was.
Uh-huh.
He'd been working in a restaurant when they met.
Uh-huh.
And, uh, they had to learn all about each other basically in a, in a weekend.
Just then.
And, uh, it was,
you knew what was going to happen, of course. That they would fall in love.
Uh-huh.
Well, they fell into like, at any rate
and and when they went to the query or inquisition or whatever, uh, they did perfectly
Right,
uh-huh.
and then he said something, because his English was so poor on, for the most part,
he, he was so proud of himself for giving all the correct answers that, that on the last one he said, oh, I never remember that answer
and that clued the investigator that he had memorized a series of answers.
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
So, uh,
