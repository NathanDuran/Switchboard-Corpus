B|Yeah,|aa
B|it is,|sv
B|yeah.|%
B|Uh, we're having,|sd
B|actually, if we find something for, uh, I'd say less than a hundred and twenty thousand, we'll be doing all right, you know.|sv

A|and she had, uh, there were seven kids in her family.|sd
B|Wow.|ba
A|And they converted the dining room and, did this and that,|sd
A|but they always seemed to get along fine, you know.|sd

A|Oh, sure.|ba
A|Oh, I know|aa
A|and it's, there's nothing harder than that.|sv
A|I always just sort of a, assign my wife that chore,|sd
A|then I would let her narrow it down to three or four,|sd
A|then I'd go look because women seem to like to look a lot more than men do.|sv
B|Oh, yeah.|aa
B|Maybe that's the case.|aap_am
B|At least she's got more opinions, you know,|sv
B|there's, uh, seems like there's more constraints more things that she thinks about. You know, openness, uh, the size of the kitchen and all this kind of stuff that I would probably gloss over and, maybe even ignore, you know.|sv

A|you say you lived in the Denver area before?|qy^d
B|Right.|na
A|How did that compare with this area as far as housing prices?|qw
B|Uh, we were, uh, really surprised to find that they're higher here. Uh,|sd
A|No kidding.|ba
B|When we moved from Louisiana to Denver, it was astounding, you know, to find that prices were, oh, I guess almost two or three times as high as we'd expected.|sd
B|And then, uh, to come down here, we thought things would be lower,|sd
B|and they're not.|sd
B|I guess, uh, really, prices for housing are just,|sv
