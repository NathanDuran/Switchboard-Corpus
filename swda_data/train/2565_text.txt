There we go.
Right.
Well, actually I'm a, I'm a Dodgers fan from way back.
Oh
Um,
how way back, I mean
Like, um, late fifties, early sixties.
Okay
so Wally Moon moon shots and all that.
What's that?
Yeah,
coliseum, Wally Moon and all that.
Yeah.
Okay,
yeah,
it's a, um,
I, I'm living in, just west of Baltimore, and Frederick, um, which is also just west of Baltimore, has a minor league team.
And, uh, and, Wally Moon is the manager of them.
Is that right?
Yeah,
so he's still kicking around.
That's interesting.
Yeah,
I, I also lived eight years in Ohio before going to, uh, going away to college,
and I used to go watch the Toledo Mudhens.
Oh, I saw them,
um, um, I was out there last Summer,
and I saw a game at Ned Skelton.
Is that the stadium?
Uh, I couldn't tell you for sure.
It's been a long time.
Oh, okay.
So, um, there used to be a, uh, race track.
Uh-huh.
Yeah,
it was,
that was impression I got when I was there
so,
Yeah,
I think that's right.
Okay,
yeah,
so had a lot of fun
actually, I mean, I like minor league baseball, a lot.
It's cheaper for one thing
Well, that's true.
I think, I've kind of become a Rangers fan over the last eleven years since I've been here.
Uh, they've led the American league in batting, fielding and pitching,
but they've never been able to do more than one of those in any, any given year.
So.
Yes
I think they're in for a odd year this year,
actually, um, they, um,
I don't understand why Encovilla got released.
I don't either.
I mean, the guy's twenty, twenty-five home rums, maybe thirty, eighty some R B I-s.
I mean, he, you know, he can't field
and, you know, he strikes out a lot,
but, I mean, he's done that for five years.
Why get rid of him now?
Really, I mean, he really has become a, a very decent fielder.
Oh, yes.
Okay.
He's not a, the liability that he was, that he used to be.
Oh, okay.
Um.
Oh, he fits right in with Texas bunch of guys, I mean with Detroit, bunch of guys that hit home runs and strike out a lot.
Yeah,
of course, get a guy like Cecil Fielder, you know,
if he strikes out a lot, so what.
Yeah,
well, I mean, with Detroit, I mean, they can get away with one guy like that.
I mean, if I, if I were in Detroit, I would start building the team around Fielder.
Oh, yeah.
But that doesn't mean get three other guys who hit, all they can do is hit home runs and strike out you know, which they did.
Right.
Yep.
So.
Well, I think the key for, for L A this year is whether Oral Herschiser can come back.
I think the pitching's deep enough that it doesn't matter.
It may be.
I, I like them a lot.
I think they're going to go all the way.
Um, and, and, I mean, by saying I like them, I like their chances.
I, I actually don't like the Dodgers,
I'm a Giants fan from way back.
Right,
right.
Well, picking up Darrell Strawberry didn't hurt.
No,
but Butler didn't hurt either.
Uh, and Bobby Ojeda didn't hurt
and,
Uh, who's the last one.
Bobby Ojeda.
They got him from the Mets for Hubie Brooks.
Oh, okay.
Um, he's a, a pretty decent pitcher.
He's,
Yes he is.
Okay,
you know, he .
Yes.
And, uh, that guy , the short stop, is going to be good.
Yeah.
Um.
Well it should be an interesting year.
Yeah,
I'm looking,
I've already been to one game,
and I should have been to two
but,
Are you an Orioles fan?
Um, the, the team I live and die with actually is the Red Sox, mostly die,
but, um, I go to the Orioles since they're here,
and I, you know, I do enjoy them.
Yeah.
Um, I've had an opening day on Monday.
Yeah,
you know, I kind of wish that they had inter league play, like they do in all the other sports so I could see some of the National League teams here once in a while.
How far is Houston?
Uh, three hundred miles.
Oh, okay,
keep forgetting how big states are out there sometimes.
Yeah,
it is, it's incredible.
Yeah,
I, um,
you know, we're, we're pretty lucky because if I want to see a National League team, I can usually go up to Philadelphia.
There you go.
And, um, saw, saw the Cardinals and Cubs last year, and a bunch of teams the year before.
Boy, you are a baseball fan, aren't you.
Okay,
uh, yeah
Interesting.
Um, I try to see whatever I can.
I mean, I've been to like thirty or forty games each of the last few years.
Wow.
Yeah,
hope I'm going to do it this year because, um, uh, having a kid this fall,
so it's like so much for going to lots of baseball games.
All right.
So, so do it while you can.
Yeah,
seriously.
Sure.
Well, it's been good talking with you.
Yeah,
good talking with you.
And, and you'll be happy I think in October when the Dodgers win.
I wouldn't mind it.
Yeah,
I'll be, I'll be upset probably even though my prediction will be right
Yeah,
well, God bless
and good talking with you.
And good talking with you.
Take care.
Bye-bye.
Bye.
