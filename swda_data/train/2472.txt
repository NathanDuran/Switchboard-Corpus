A|Uh, well for a dinner party, I think one of my favorite things is baked chicken and white wine.|sd
B|That's, that's really weird that you said that because for a dinner party, mine is, is a, is a chicken in a marsala wine sauce,|sd
A|Oh|b
B|so Where did you get your recipe for it?|qw
A|Um, I guess mostly out of an international cookbook that I have.|sd

B|a little bit sweeter.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And it, uh, it's a, it's a red wine.|sd
A|Okay.|b
B|And, uh, I'm trying to think what else.|sd
B|I, I roll it in bread crumbs and, uh, Parmesan cheese,|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and, then I rub it with a little bit, I rub the chicken with a little bit of oil, and pour the wine sauce over it as, like the last twenty minutes, so that it gets just enough flavor.|sd
A|Huh.|b
A|Oh.|b
A|Oh, so it kind of browns|sd
A|and then you put wine over it.|sd
B|Right.|b
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|That sounds real good.|ba
B|And, it's really easy too|sd

B|What time should we be there?|bh
B|That sounds wonderful|ba
A|It is, it's great.|sv
B|I love desserts,|sd
B|but since there's only two of us, it's really,|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b

A|Right.|b
A|I know, I know what you mean.|sd
A|We don't eat desserts much any more.|sd
B|But I, I guess one that, that I really like, that I haven't made in awhile,|sd
B|and it's, it's called a fruit pizza.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And you take a, uh, sugar cookie, uh, recipe, and, and spread it out on a pizza pan.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|So you make it like a pizza crust,|sd
B|and then you, you bake that|sd
B|and then you, um, take things like kiwi, and strawberries and bananas and whatever fresh fruit you want|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and you mix that with, um, excuse me, you use cream cheese and a little bit of orange juice|sd
B|and I can't remember what else is in it|sd
B|and you make kind of a glaze,|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and then you layer your fresh fruit on that.|sd
A|Oh, and pour that over it?|qy^d
B|Yeah.|ny
A|That sounds great.|ba
