B|So how many, um, credit cards do you have?|qw
A|Um, I think I'm down to one.|sd
B|Oh, my gosh,|ba
B|I wish I was that way.|sd
B|Is that why you said I had more experience than you?|qy
A|Well, no.|nn
A|I was pulling your leg.|sd
B|Oh.|bk
B|Well, how, how do you use your credit card?|qw
B|I mean, do you just keep it in reserve,|qy
B|or.|%
A|I, I, well,|%
A|the way I'd like to try and use it is, um, you, you, you make your purchases at, at prime buying time|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and then you pay that off and don't use it until, uh, it's paid off.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|That's, that's my ideal way|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|How, how do you use it?|qw
A|Emergencies come along,|sd
A|and I and I use it.|sd
B|Yeah|b
B|that's understandable, exactly.|ba
A|Uh, like, uh, my car, uh, had a major problem, and seven hundred dollars,|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and uh, things just come up|sd
B|Right,|b
B|right.|b
A|and you just never get to use it the way you'd really like to.|sv
B|Uh-huh,|aa
B|uh-huh.|aa
B|Well, actually I do have quite a few more credit cards than you have|sd
B|Um, and I use them, you know,|sd
B|like my American Express I use for, you know, gas, things like that,|sd
B|and I pay that off monthly,|sd
B|and then, um, some other credit cards, like store credit cards, you know, I do have them up there a little bit,|sd
B|but, uh.|%
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|I try not to use them too often.|sd
B|But living in this area, uh, like I live fifteen miles west of Washington, D C|sd
A|Um.|b
B|it's a very expensive area|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|So, sometimes you have no other choice if you need to buy something.|sv
A|Yeah.|aa
A|Well, I, I know I was up in there and a lot of credit cards,|sd
A|and I was just starting to get to where it was getting me in trouble|sd
B|Right.|b
A|so we just disposed of them, paid them off, and got out of it.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|I just.|%
B|Uh-huh,|b
B|well that was good that you had the opportunity to do that.|sv
A|Yeah.|b
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Now are you married, that you both, you and your wife use a credit card,|qy
B|or?|%
A|Yeah,|ny
A|yeah.|ny
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|Well, now we pretty much just pay cash for as much as we can there.|sd
B|Uh-huh. Um.|b
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|Our, our only credit card is Sears,|sd
A|so and I have that for automotive purposes.|sd
B|Uh-huh, um.|b
B|Right,|b
B|right.|b
B|Well, well that's great.|ba
B|Um, everyone I know here uses, um, credit cards like they're going out of business to be honest with you.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
A|Yeah,|b
A|it's, it's just too easy, basically, uh, just get yourself in trouble with those.|sv
B|Yeah,|aa
B|yeah.|aa
B|Yeah,|aa
B|the only other one I have,|sd
B|I have like a Diner's Club through my, um, where I work|sd
A|I see.|b
B|so that I use, because I travel some.|sd
B|So I use that,|sd
B|and I don't really have to worry about that, because I only use it for business,|sd
B|so I automatically have the money to pay it off.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|But. Um.|%
A|Uh, I wouldn't mind, uh, you know, getting back into one if they would, you know,|sd
A|you start out at a low limit,|sv
A|and then they just keep wanting you to increase your limit|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and, and if I can get one that'll keep my limit at five hundred and I can never go over that or something like that, then that's fine,|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|but they|%
A|eventually gets up there to five thousand, ten thousand, whatever fifty thousand|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Yeah.|b
A|forget it,|ba
A|I don't want that.|sd
B|Um, the temptation's too great.|sv
A|Yeah.|b
B|Um.|b
A|So, I don't know,|h
A|just, uh,|%
A|writing checks is just as easy I guess.|sv
B|Yeah,|aa
B|that's true,|aa
B|that's true,|aa
B|but. So, I guess, uh, we've kind of exhausted this, uh, topic|fc
A|Yeah,|fc
A|well, really,|%
A|what, what can you.|%
B|Yeah,|fc
B|you can't say too much about it really.|fc
A|Other than, you use them or you don't use them.|fc
A|You like them|fc
A|or you don't like them.|fc
A|So.|%
B|Uh-huh.|fc
A|I guess, uh, they don't care if we end it early.|fc
A|So, uh, hopefully, uh, you have a good Thanksgiving.|fc
A|That's coming up,|fc
A|and. And, then, uh, maybe we'll talk again.|fc
B|Okay,|fc
