A|think about this?|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
B|Uh, do you have children in school?|qy
A|I do.|na
B|Uh, I have two that are, uh, now just about ready to graduate from college|sd
A|Uh.|b
B|but I also have two that are just entering school.  Uh, well *sv I think they're just pushing them entirely to fast.|sd
A|So you see a big difference then in before and  now do you|qy
A|or,|%
A|A lot of testing?|qy
B|Uh, well it seems to me that kindergarten is now the equivalent of first grade.|no
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|My son leaves the house at seven thirty and doesn't get home until three o'clock.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And I think that's such a long day for a kindergartner.|sv
A|I do too,|aa
A|I, oh, I think that's awful.|sv
B|And, uh, I have a preschooler.|sd
B|Uh, I was told by her preschool teacher that she thought maybe she was to immature for kindergarten|sd
B|and I thought well how mature do you have to be|sd
A|I know.|aa
A|What's the new criteria, huh.|qh
B|And, uh, there is a,|%
B|do you have the standardized testing now?|qy
A|We have all kinds of testing|na
A|and it's over and over.|sd
A|It's I T B S or, and, uh, just everything, everything.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|And they test, test, test.|sd
A|I live in Plano actually|sd
A|and I don't know if you've heard of Plano|qy^d
A|but  it's a very transient community.|sd
B|No.|nn
A|A lot of people from everywhere,|sd
A|it's just north of Dallas|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and it's grown in leaps and bounds.|sd
A|I, we must have maybe a hundred and fifty thousand people now.|sd
B|Oh.|b
A|And most of them from other places.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|Uh, J C Penney's come down from New York and, of course, T I and Xerox from Rochester|sd
A|and we just, have lots of people from everywhere. Lots of industry coming in,|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|and it's a very wealthy community.|sd
A|Uh, not that I am|sd
A|but other people seem,  to be|sv
A|and I would love to know why|%
A|but I mean they do.|sd
A|They have,|%
B|you would like to know what they're doing right|bf
A|I, I would,|aa
A|I really would.|aa
A|I mean, they just have beautiful, beautiful homes|sd
A|and they have everything.|sd
A|The kids only wear name brand things to school|sd
A|and it's one of these things,|sv
B|Oh me.|ba
B|Well that makes it hard for you, doesn't it.|qy
A|Well it does, you know.|na
A|It really does because I'm a single mom and I have a thirteen year old now|sd
A|and uh, you know, it does.|sd
B|Oh, me.|ba
A|I mean, we do it to a point|sd
A|but  uh, not to where she feels different,|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|but  some of them are very rich|sd
B|It's hard to explain to them why you can't.|bf
A|and so, uh, we just kind of have, everything here|sd
A|and we have a very goal oriented population because their parents are.|sd
B|Right.|b
A|And so I don't know how much of it, is us and how much of it is Texas|sv
A|but the kids are expected to excel in, everything.|sv
B|Oh, dear.|ba
A|And it's almost impossible because you have so many children and just so many activities that everybody can't be first|sv
A|and they're  expected to be.|sv
B|Right.|b
A|You know, their parents expect it,|sv
A|the teachers expect it,|sv
A|Texas wants very badly to be considered tops in the school system|sv
B|Right|b
A|and if you read national surveys, they're far from it.|sd
A|And so there's just a whole lot of testing and a whole lot of pushing to do well on these tests.|sv
B|How about the kids.|qo
B|How are they coping with it?|qw
A|Well, not very well.|sd
A|They bring home notes that say they have to get a good night's sleep and eat right in the morning before, tests.|sd
B|Huh.|b
A|I mean they make a big deal.|sv
A|To me, the paper should just be put on the desk that day|sv
A|and say just do this.|sv
B|Right.|b
A|You know, I just feel they do better that way.|sv
B|Yeah.|aa
B|Rather than  anticipating.|bf
A|And,|%
A|Yeah.|b
A|And, and I have older children too that now are out of high school|sd
A|and they've always done this here.|sd
A|I mean it's always been the same|sv
A|but it is, it's getting worse and worse,|sv
A|is more pressure for everything. *listen|sv
A|And I just think it's really awful|sv
A|and I, I'm with you on that.|aa
A|You don't hear too many people say this,|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
A|but I think it's a very long day.|sv
B|Oh, it is.|ba
A|And my feeling is that, you know, you're only a kid once, and you don't want to  spend your whole life in school.|sv
B|That's right.|aa
B|My son said that, came home|sd
B|and he said, he said Mom, all we do is work.|sd
A|Uh-huh,|b
A|uh-huh.|b
B|We hardly ever play|^q
B|and,|%
A|And I don't think that's right.|sv
A|I think we should do what Europe does and include cultural activities in our school system.|sv
B|Oh, likewise.|aa
A|I don't think I should have to pay for dancing lessons, gymnastics, piano.|sv
B|Right.|aa
A|I would like to see those things included in our school system  because I think we should have well-rounded kids not just book smart kids.|sv
B|Wouldn't that be great.|ba
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Right.|aa
A|And so I just find this a real problem.|sv
A|I think if they're going to be there all day, they should find time.|sv
A|One of my daughters, once, was out of school with Mono in her junior year I think it was.|sd
A|And she had a home teacher for like four hours a week|sd
A|and when she went back in six weeks, she was ahead.|sd
A|So what  does that tell you?|qh
B|Is that right?|bh
A|It tells you there's a whole  lot of wasted time.|sv
B|Oh, my gosh.|ba
B|Oh, my gosh.|ba
A|And they could be using this time better.|sv
B|Well, for example, in my son's kindergarten. They're really finished at lunch time.|sd
B|After lunch, they have some, uh,|sd
B|I'm trying to think if they have recess after lunch,|^h
B|and then they have naps or rest period.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And, uh, I think either send them home or do something  a little more interesting.|sd
A|That's a very long day for kindergartners.|ba
B|I agree.|aa
A|But I think that working parents have kind of demanded this.|sv
B|I wouldn't be surprised.|ba
A|You know, because they don't, they don't want to send them to daycare.|sv
B|I doubt if they would say it was too long|sv
A|That's why they want them there because them somebody takes care of them all day|sv
B|Uh, do you have the before school care, at your school and the after school care?|qy
A|We have them at one school like,|na
