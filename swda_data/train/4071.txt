A|Well Jackie, uh, on taxes, I, I guess I would have to say, that I, that my opinion is that I do think Americans are paying too much in taxes.|sv
A|Uh, what's your feeling about that?|qo
B|I agree.|aa
B|I think taxes are high.|sv
A|Right,|b
A|uh, where you live do you have a state income tax and a sales tax both?|qy
B|Oh, yes.|ny
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|Uh, uh-huh.|bk
A|In New Hampshire we have, uh, uh, no, no, what we call broad base taxes.|sd
A|No income tax and no sales tax.|sd
B|Huh.|b
A|Uh, we tax business, uh, eight percent,|sd
A|businesses are taxed eight percent|sd
A|and we have what we call the five B s. Uh, for our taxes. Booze, uh, butts, cigarettes, beds, uh, hotel room tax bellies, a meal tax and bets, gambling.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Oh.|b
A|So, uh, we do have a very low tax rate,|sd
A|but you know, combined with the federal income tax. I think that Americans generally do pay too much in taxes|sv
A|and .|%
B|Right.|b
B|Yeah,|b
B|I, I agree|aa
B|and I, think it's about the time of the year when you just start getting,|sv
B|well if you do get money back from like jobs,|sv
B|I'm still a student so, uh, I only work part time,|sd
A|Uh-huh|b
B|so I, I get a check back|sd
B|so|%
A|Well that's nice.|ba
B|from, from taxes|sd
B|but,|%
A|Nice, nice to get a refund.|sv
B|Yeah|aa
B|It is,|sv
B|but it's not much.|sd
B|So.|%
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Do you think that, uh, for whatever taxes we do pay that, uh, we are getting value for it?|qy
B|No.|nn
A|Yeah.|aa
A|Uh, my, my opinion of taxes is that we just send money to Washington or to the state|sv
A|and they say they are going to send some back,|sv
A|it's like giving yourself a it's like one arm giving the other a transfusion.|sv
B|Yeah.|b
A|You know what I mean?|bh
B|Yeah.|ny
A|Uh, it, it really, uh,|%
A|I should say one arm giving another arm a transfusion through a leaky tube because,  Right because, uh, there's an old saying in amongst taxes and politicians that there's a fly paper effect|sv
B|Yeah.|b
B|There you go|ba
A|and that is that money tends to stick where it lands first|sv
A|and when you send it to Washington or send it to your state capitol, uh, a lot of it stays there and not that much comes back to you.|sv
B|Right,|b
B|yeah.|b
B|I don't know.|h
B|I,|%
B|don't seem like they are doing much with it,|sv
B|I mean there's plans there|sv
B|and now that they are voting and people, you know, getting into drug and that stuff.|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|They have nice plans|sv
B|and, uh, but, they don't always work|sv
B|and then you know they try to raise taxes more|sv
B|and I don't what happens with all the money because if their plans don't work,|sv
B|you know, but taxes get raise|sd
B|so. I don't know.|h
B|I'm not really into politics, uh|sd
A|That it,|%
B|I don't really understand it|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|but it's just you know|%
A|Well, it does it, it does seem that the more taxes that are raised the more the politicians spend.|sv
A|Uh, it's almost like they will spend as much as the, they're allowed to collect. You know.|sv
B|Right.|b
A|Uh, there is an interesting proposal that's been going around now for a few years of having a flat tax. Uh, ten percent or thirteen percent.|sd
A|There would be no figuring.|sd
A|I mean you would take your income tax,|sd
A|you would have a certain amount,|sd
A|I mean you would take you total salary|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|those who made under a certain amount wouldn't owe any taxes,|sd
A|and then there would be a set amount for however many people, you know, dependent you have,|sd
A|and you would just pay a flat tax. No exemptions, no deductions or anything else after you know, after you figure up who's in your family.|sd
B|Right.|b
B|Huh.|b
A|And that would eliminate a lot of the bureaucracy in the I R S|sv
A|and it would eliminate all these loop holes that the fat cats get away with.|sv
B|Yeah.|b
B|The could be nice|ba
A|Yeah.|b
B|Huh.|b
A|I, I'd like to see something like that.|sv
A|I think it would be fairer|sv
A|and it would put a, you know, a lot of the tax attorneys our of business|sv
A|and I am sure they will fight it tooth and nail,|sv
A|but I really think a flat tax would be a lot fairer for all Americans.|sv
B|Right,|b
B|yeah.|b
A|I mean it doesn't seem right that somebody that makes twenty-five or thirty thousand dollars pays four or five thousand dollars in taxes while somebody that makes two hundred and fifty thousand dollars might pay nothing in taxes.|sd
B|Right,|b
B|huh.|b
A|It doesn't seem fair to me.|sd
B|Yeah,|aa
B|it isn't,|sv
B|there is not much out there that is fair,|sv
B|that's for sure.|sv
A|Right.|b
B|Huh.|%
B|I will agree to that.|aa
A|I think your taxes in Wisconsin are pretty high. I, I, if I am not mistaken, aren't they? I mean for your state.|qy
B|Uh,|%
A|What is, do you know what your state income tax rate is?|qy
B|Um, no|nn
A|Twenty percent?|qy^d
B|I, I have no idea,|no
B|I just.|%
