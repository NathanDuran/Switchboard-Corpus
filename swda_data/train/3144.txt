A|Oh|b

A|Oh, well good.|ba
A|I'm, I'm glad to hear that because they,|sd
B|Oh, they are, are|aa

A|Uh-huh|b
B|Just, they just carried it off, to the tee.|sv
A|Well, I don't, I don't know if you got to see WEEKEND, um, AT BERNIE'S  that was out a couple of years ago.|qy^d

B|Shoot,|ba
B|yeah.|aa
A|It was so funny and it sounds like, uh, what you were just describing, SOAPDISH, too.|sv
A|I mean, we just, we hurt by the time we came out.|sd
B|Oh yeah.|b
A|And the whole theater was hysterical|sd
A|and it's just, it's just goofy.|sv
A|I mean, it's, uh,|%

A|Um, cause it's, it's just a fun summer light comedy,|sv
A|make your cheeks hurt laughing.|sv

A|I, I imagine the way SOAPDISH was, but, with   everyone laughing.|sv
B|Oh gosh|ba
B|I never laughed.|sd
B|And people were just screaming and applauding|sd
B|and, you know, it was just hysterical.|sv
A|Well, I'm glad you did that before your surgery|sd

A|Oh, gosh.|ba
B|but see I don't have permanent work.|sd
B|I, right now I'm working with a temporary agency.|sd
B|And so, the second week I was out of the hospital I went up and worked half day on the computers cause you can learn all the software for free.|sd
A|Oh.|b
B|Oh, so I went up to do WordPerfect cause that seems like that's what everybody wants,|sd
B|and I was up there half a day and came home and collapsed.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|And then they called me to see if I wanted to work a day.|sd
B|And I said, yeah,|sd
B|and I went|sd
B|and of course it took me the whole weekend to recover from that.|sd
B|And, uh, I worked about three days a week ever since, two to three days a week.|sd
B|And so I went to my doctors last Thursday,|sd
B|and this was my fourth week checkup|sd

B|I just can't get over this.|^q
B|He says, in two weeks you can go back to doing your crazy normal things.|sd
B|If you want to play ball, you can go play ball.|^q
B|He says, now I'm not going to say you're going to feel like playing ball|sd

A|Yeah|b
B|And, uh, you know, he was teasing me|sd
B|and he says, yeah,|sd

B|I can just see it now.|^q
B|And, uh, he says so you just take it easy for two more weeks.|sd
B|You've only got two more weeks.|^q

B|Whatever you call easy, I'll do it, you know.|^q
B|But and I've been out trying to find a job because this is just not cutting it.|sd
A|Yeah.|b

A|Uh, and that's what he would have liked to have seen REGARDING HENRY, too,|sd
A|but knew that, uh,|%
A|we've, we've got a lot of company this summer, which is wonderful.|sv

B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and he said, well, realistically  You know, he knew he couldn't get them all in.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|But, uh, Jay really liked ROBIN HOOD.|sd
A|Um, when the choir group went to see BACKDRAFT and they thought that was, uh, it was funny cause he sounded like the critics.|sd
A|He said, you know the plot line and the characters, uh, you know aren't real big|sd
A|but the, the fire scenes and the you know  that action part is fantastic.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|But, he thought ROBIN HOOD was great.|sd
