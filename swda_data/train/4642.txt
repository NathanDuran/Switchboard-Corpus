A|I , uh, try to stay away from cars as much as possible in terms of  repair.|sd
A|Actually, uh, that is really a sore spot with me.|sd
A|I, I think perhaps the automotive industry is improving|sv
A|but, uh, like ten years ago, uh, reliability of automobiles, at least U S automobiles was pretty dismal|sv
A|and not only that, but the, uh, repair capability of, uh, service departments and dealerships was equally dismal|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and, uh, it seemed that the only way I could reliably take care of my car was to repair it myself which is not my cup of tea.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|But, uh, I,|%
B|So do you have a car?|qy
A|Pardon?|br
B|Do you have a car?|qy
A|Well, at that time, actually, I had a Volkswagen Rabbit|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and, uh, it was, it was a real lemon.|sd
A|Uh, subsequently I got a, uh, Buick Century|sd
A|and it wasn't as bad.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|But, uh, last year I bought a Honda Accord|sd
A|and I take it in once every seventy-five hundred miles for its periodic maintenance|sd
A|and that is it.|sd
A|And it's wonderful.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
B|We used to have a Honda Accord|sd
B|and they're good.|sv
B|They're really good cars.|sv
B|Every time I get taken to an auto repair place, you know, every time I go, I get taken.|sd
B|Bad you know.|%
A|Huh.|b
B|Woman goes in|sv
B|and they go all right, we got a sucker.|sv
B|Let's see how much money we can get out of her, you know|^q
A|Huh.|b
B|That's what happens every time.|sv
A|Huh.|b
B|Uh, so,|%
A|So, what do you have?|qo
B|I have a Pontiac Six Thousand.|sd
A|All the more reason to, uh, have a, a Honda.|sv
B|Yeah.|aa
B|But our Honda just got old and just wore out.|sd
B|It was, let's see, eleven years old|sd
B|and it just, just out of it|%
A|so you bought a Pontiac?|qy
B|huh-uh.|nn
B|My uh, ex-husband's,|%
B|this is, just happened a couple of weeks ago.|sd
B|He's my ex-husband|sd
B|but just a few months ago when he was my husband, uh, his father gave us this car|sd
B|and everything is wrong with it.|sd
B|I mean, the power steering fluid leaks, the oil leaks, the brake fluid leaks, you know,|sd
A|Now|%
A|how old is the car?|qw
B|Uh, eighty-seven.|sd
A|Huh.|b
B|And he just doesn't take care of things|sd
B|and but I was awarded the car|sd
B|so. There is a man in my church that is a mechanic|sd
B|and I can trust him.|sd
B|So he is trying to get, you know, things fixed on it.|sd
A|Huh.|b
B|But it's just, you know, leak, leak, leak everywhere.|sd
B|But, uh, you know, I hate to go into a, a repair place because they'll tell me something is wrong with it and it's not, you know, and charge me twice as much.|sv
B|The last time I took it into a repair shop,|sd
B|the man told me I needed a master cylinder.|sd
B|So I said okay.|sd
B|And he charged me a hundred and thirty something dollars|sd
B|and then, uh, about a month later, a man was looking at my car|sd
B|and he asked me,|sd
B|you know, not a man, not a repair man, but just a friend|sd
B|and I was telling him that I just a new master cylinder put on|sd
B|and he looked at|sd
B|and he said that's not a new master cylinder|sd
A|Huh.|b
B|and I didn't even know what one was.|sd
B|And, uh, he showed it to me|sd
B|and it was old, rusty, just awful.|sd
B|It was no more new than nothing.|sd
A|So apparently it was the same one that was on there.|bf
B|Uh, more than likely.|aa
A|Apparently just, uh, uh, probably filled the, the brake fluid up|bf
A|and that was it.|bf
B|That was it, probably.|aa
B|It was|%
B|I was so irritated.|sd
B|And that's happened to me more than once or twice. just, just about every time I've went in somewhere.|sd
A|So what's the solution to that? I guess find a reputable service,|sv
B|And, and you can hardly find one, you know.|sv
A|Huh.|b
B|The guy that's doing most of my, my car now, uh, goes to my church|sd
B|and that's the only reason, you know, I go to him because I know him|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and I know he will tell me the truth.|sd
B|Because he doesn't even charge me for, for doing it|sd
B|so he's not going to, you know, take me.|sd
A|Right.|b
B|I just pay for the parts|sd
B|and he does it so.|sd
A|Well that's wonderful.|ba
B|Yeah.|aa
A|You're lucky.|sv
B|Yeah,|aa
B|I am,|aa
B|so, I don't know.|h
B|I don't know what the solution to that is because the place where you buy your car, they're usually the worst one of all.|sv
B|We took our Honda to the Honda dealership|sd
B|and they ended up telling us we needed a brand new engine for our car.|sd
A|Oh, really?|bh
B|Yeah.|ny
B|And so, idiots as we were, neither one of us knew much about cars,|sd
B|we, you know, they told us we just had to have one|sd
B|and we bought one.|sd
B|We didn't no more need no new engine,|sd
B|give me break, you know.|sd
A|Huh.|b
B|So it was, it was not good|sd
B|and, uh|%
