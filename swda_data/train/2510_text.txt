Okay,
do you have any pets?
Yeah,
I have three cats and a dog.
Oh, boy.
Sound like us,
we have,
Um,
go ahead.
Um, we just got the, the dog less than a year ago
so, he's still a puppy.
Oh, what kind is it?
He's a mixed breed,
he's part Collie, part Shepherd, and part Chow.  More Collie  and Shepherd than Chow,
Oh, so you  ,
the only Chow he's got is, is his tongue.
Oh, he's got a blue tongue?
Yeah.
Oh.
He's got little spots on them.
We have two Chows and, a miniature Schnauzer, and recently added, a guinea pig, which wasn't by my choice,
but I was out ruled,
so, but the dogs are mainly mine and my
but I just love them to death.
Was the guinea pig for your, for your child?
Daughter,
yes.
Yes,
as if the dogs weren't enough, had to have, a guinea pig,
so, anyway she's, she enjoys her though,
so that's, that's what matters.
But, um, our Chows, we've had them, I'd say, right around six maybe seven years
and,
Really?
they're, um, registered
and we've been breeding them.
She's had about four or five litters.
Oh, my, my husband's always wanted a Chow
but I'm kind of concerned about, um, with having cats, and how, how they socialize with cats. Um, which is one of the reasons why we got a mixed breed.
Oh.
Right.
Um, because we thought they would socialize easier,
Uh-huh.
um, my husband had originally wanted an
and his brother has an
and he, so far he's bitten ten people.
Oh, man.
So,
Goodness.
And the people that he got the from, used to have cats
and they no longer have any other cats.
So,
It's telling, um, you know
when we had, um, we had a cat when we first married, no, took ,
yeah,
we had the cat first,
and then we got, uh, the Chow.
And, bring, um, bringing them in as puppies they got along just fabulous with her.
Uh-huh.
And, uh, you would think, you know, that they were all dogs the way she would prance around them and, and paw at their face
and they'd just play
and they were never, they never harmed her.
So, uh, they got along great,
now I don't know how, how it would be bringing in, uh, like cat to a full, full grown dog.
Yeah,
I wouldn't want to bring a cat into a full grown dog,
Yeah.
but I, I wouldn't feel, um, hesitant about bringing a puppy in, to adult cats,
Right.
I think they would socialize easier.
I think, so, too.
Um, how, how old is your child?
Five
Five?
She's a real .
So, you had the dogs before you had the baby?
Right.
And I was, not really concerned about, um, them harming her, uh,
I think, I think a lot of that, that, that we hear all the time is how you bring them up.
Uh-huh.
And ours are real friendly,
they're protective,
but they're very friendly, and lovable,
Uh-huh.
I mean, you think they're lapdogs. You know,
they'll just come jump on your lap and want to be, have their bellies rubbed and everything
and,
What color are they?
Uh, the female's red
and the male is black.
Oh, I bet the black one's pretty.
Yeah,
he is, he's a big old thing.
And, um, I was concerned about the female mainly,
and as luck had it, uh, she had puppies the same week my daughter was born,
so, it was kind of like, she had her babies and understood about, you know,
About your  baby.
yeah,
and that,
yeah,
I think that really helped and, um, my daughter, you know, since, since she's little has been playing with them
and they let her tug their hair and, and get on their back or whatever
and she's, she's grown up with them and loves them to death
and they love her,
so.
Yeah,
I think it's good for kids to grow up around pets, as, as long as they don't have any allergies to them or anything.
I do, too.
Yeah.
But I think it really helps them to understand when, when they go to other people's houses
and they have pets,
I see so many times kids just, you know,
they, mean to animals not really understanding that the animals have feelings.
Yeah, exactly,
that or, or, uh, the other extreme,
they're, they're terrified of them
and I hate that,
Yeah,
Yeah.
and they shouldn't be,
I mean, some maybe
but, but, um, like our miniature Schnauzer, she's just, she's just like, um, a little hyper thing and just prances around and jumps all over everybody acting silly,
and a lot of kids are scared of that. And which I understand because she is, you know, a lot of movement and everything
but when she calms down they're so scared of her
it's,
Huh.
it, that bothers me because she's the friendliest thing,
she wouldn't you know, harm them at all
and, and, and that's mainly people that have never had pets around their children,
so, I think, I think it's a good idea to have them.
We've had, um, in the past, we've had birds, too, uh, like Cockatoos. And parrots and, The big white, birds with the, the orange crest on top.
Uh-huh.
Now,
the, the Cockatoos, are those the big ones?
Yeah.
Yeah.
We've had those,
and those are neat,
they're messy, very messy, yeah, and loud.
Are they?
Oh, a lot louder than a dog, you know,
a dog you can tell, stop barking, you know, or whatever.
Yeah.
But the birds, you, it's hard to keep them from squawking or whatever
but, but they were neat, enjoyable animals to have.
Well, we've thought about getting an aquarium, partly, partly for the cats,
Uh-huh.
I think the cats would really enjoy it, um,
Yeah,
with a lid,
yeah,
yeah,
of course, um,
but so far we just
and starting up an an aquarium,
we, we're, thinking about getting a saltwater,
Oh,  yeah
they,
and they're  so, expensive to start up.
Yes,
yes,
they are,
and in your, the luck of keeping them alive, through those first, you know, few  days.
Yeah.
Yeah.
The,  the saltwater fish have so much more color
and they're so, much more beautiful,
I know they are.
Um, the freshwater tank's just,
really to me they'll, there's,
most of them really aren't that pretty,
no.
you know, I really I really don't care much for them.
Right,
I don't blame you there,
I think the saltwater are a lot more attractive than,
I don't know,
those fish are just beautiful.
Just so,
like you have a little bit of ocean with you or something
Yeah,
Yeah.
Rather than just little fish.
But I don't mind having,
Wren
my daughter had a, like a little goldfish, a about a year or two ago
Uh-huh.
and it finally died
and that was neat,
but and they're, you know,
she can't play with it,
you can just look at it.
Yeah,
yeah.
You know, you can't roll around and tussle around with it like you can a dog or a cat
and,
Yeah,
I wouldn't, I wouldn't dare have a, a goldfish here because, it would probably be in a small bowl
and then my cats would knock it over.
Yeah.
I have to be real careful about where I put things,
Uh-huh.
if the cats will, will jump up on things and knock things over all  the time,
Oh, no.
Oh, no.
They're always up where they don't, where they're not supposed to be.
Yes,
yeah,
and that's hard.
that's just like kids, you know,
they know that they're not supposed to do it,
but they're going to do it anyway because they know they're not supposed to.
That's right
and they're so, independent.
I love having them for that reason.
Yeah,
yeah,
and until we got the dog, um, it was real easy to, to go to town for three three day weekend or whatever,
Sure.
and now, it's like a major production, trying to find somebody to take care of the dog while you're gone.
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
That's right,
that is hard.
And, I,
we knew it,
but we never even thought that about when we got the dog
we just saw him, oh,
he's so, cute,
Oh.
let's take him home.
Yes.
You know, and then the first weekend we had him we had, we were in a apartment, in a two bedroom apartment,
Uh-huh.
and my husband went out of town, and left me with, with the brand new puppy,
Oh, fun.
and I had to work twelve hours that day,
Oh, no.
and so, I left the dog locked in the bedroom
and I put paper all over the floor.
Well, when I came home, I opened the door
and there were chunks of carpet, padding everything, all over the place
Oh.
Oh, no.
and he had tried to dig his way out from underneath the door,
Oh, no.
I guess you didn't get your deposit back, did you?
Well, I had the carpet fixed,
Oh, good.
um, I, yeah, I didn't even tell the apartment manager, who got it.
Oh, okay.
Oh, no.
Bless your heart.
But that, that was my first real experience with, with a puppy
when, when we had our family dog growing up I was eleven or twelve, I think, when we first got him,
Uh-huh.
and I wasn't really involved in the, the paper training, and, you know, teaching him commands and stuff
Sure.
Yeah.
so, this was, and to me, a whole new experience.
Yes
it is.
Only it wasn't like cats at all.
No,
no.
I wish it was.
I wish they were in that instinct.
But they don't.
So,
Our only problem with our Schnauzer, she's an indoor dog most of the time
Uh-huh.
and, uh, we found, she's right at a year
and we finally got her, you know, house trained and everything, uh,
her only problem is trash.
If you do not pick the trash up, you know, the container, and put it on a table or chair or something, she'll knock it over,
Uh-huh.
I don't care how full she is,
so, it's not like she's hungry,
it's just she wants to get into trouble.
My cats do that it.
If I through anything away that's any kind of meat or anything, like that,
Uh-huh.
anything that, that they think is good,
they'll get into the trash,
Yeah.
and then it doesn't matter where you put it and where you hide it,
Yeah.
and how, how tight you have the lid down on it,
they'll get into it.
I've come home many a days from work to find trash all over the kitchen floor.
Oh, I hate that.
And the cat's just looking at me like, sorry.
Yeah,
you  shouldn't have left it there.
I couldn't help myself.
I just hate that when she does that,
I just, oh,
and she knows it's wrong,
you'll walk in the door
and she'll cower and go hide under the table.
Uh-huh.
So, you, she knows she does wrong.
But she, uh, she continues to do it,
so.
Yeah,
the problem that we're having with our puppy right now he's not
he's actually not really a puppy anymore
he's like sixteen months old,
Uh-huh.
um, but he's still chewing.
Oh, is he?
Um, the last thing he chewed up was, uh, when we ...
