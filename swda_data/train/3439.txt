B|Okay.|b
B|How do I make use of credit cards?|b^m
A|Yes.|ny
B|Um, let's see.|^h
B|I carry a lot of credit cards with me mostly because I don't ever have cash.|sd
A|Right.|b
B|And I I,|%
B|do you work for Texas Instruments?|qy
A|No,|nn
A|I do not.|sd
B|Okay.|bk
B|Well, at T I we have to use what's called a tex teller if we want to get cash out|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and those are only available at T I.|sd
A|Oh, okay.|b
B|So if I'm in a mall or something I can't get cash out without paying extra money|sd
B|so I'm always using credit cards.|sd
A|Sure.|b
A|Well, myself I always,|%
A|I'm, I'm a traveling person|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and I'm out of town quite a bit|sd
A|so I use credit cards quite a lot also as far as everything from service work and gasoline in my car to my lounging, entertainment and for everything.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|aa
B|Yeah,|aa
B|me too.|aa
A|So that's, uh,|%
A|as far as using them outside that I'm not, I don't use them too much|sd
A|but I, I think my wife is sort of like you|sd
A|she uses a credit card,  most of the time.|sd
B|Yeah|b
A|So she does most of the shopping for our household|sd
A|so she'll use them more than I will.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|But do you get to pay the bills?|qy
A|Yes.|ny
B|Same at my house|sd
A|So it's me I'm always, I'm the guy that always goes to like Dillard's|sd
A|and I'll go in and charge something|sd
A|and I'll have to give them my driver's license.|sd
A|They'll have to look up the number because I'm never carrying a credit card.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Yeah.|b
A|But I do carry like my American Express and my Visa which I use for, you know, primarily work type things.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Yeah.|b
A|This is my first call by the way,|sd
A|so|%
B|Oh, it's mine too.|sd
A|Oh, is it really?|bh
B|Yes.|ny
A|All right|ba
A|so we're both beginners then.|sv
B|Yeah.|b
A|I've had this for a couple weeks|sd
A|and I've been out of town|sd
A|so this is my first time to,  to use it.|sd
B|Oh, okay.|b
B|Okay.|b
A|So,|%

A|Okay.|b
A|When you call the eight hundred number, they assign you a topic and, uh, pretty, uh, cut and dried|sd
B|Huh,|b
B|okay.|b
B|Um, let's see.|^h
B|So how long are we supposed to talk for?|qw
A|I'm not sure.|h
A|A couple,|sv
A|about two three minutes I think.|sv
B|Okay.|bk
A|But I really don't have too much more to say in regards to credit cards.|sd
A|I,|%
A|one thing I've always tried to do is when I get my credit cards, I always try to pay them off because I just sort of detest paying interest.|sd
B|Oh, yes.|ba
A|And, uh,|%
B|Definitely.|aa
A|like years ago my wife and I got married|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|she was the one with a little bit than I was because I had my credit cards, I think, up to the limit|sd
A|and I was giving everyone ten dollars a month and everything like that.|sd
B|Oh.|b
B|That will cost you a fortune.|sv
A|That was like thirty years ago|sd
A|so now it's a little different.|sd
A|We,|%
A|I get a bill|sd
A|and I'll pay it the same day it comes|sd
B|Yes,|b
B|yes.|b
A|and I just kind of tell my kids how much I hate paying interest|sd
A|so they should follow the same rule.|sd
B|That's right.|b
B|Well, yeah,|b
A|Oh, you bet it's|ba
A|it's an absolute savings.|sd
B|Or if you travel for work and you get your reimbursement before the bill comes in,  you get to keep the money.|sd
A|You bet.|ba
A|That's, that's very handy.|sd
B|Yeah.|aa
B|It works great.|aa
A|Well, I think that's all I have.|sd
