Uh, well, uh, the Cowboys are my favorite team.
That's pretty easy to say nowadays
Lot easier than it was a couple years ago,
but they had a big win today.
Uh, did you get to watch it?
No,
I didn't.
I, uh, have been at my computer all day
so,
Oh.
Are you a Cowboy fan?
Well, I used to be a real big Cowboy fan
and, and, uh, I'm not a Jimmy Johnson fan.
Being an Okie I just really don't care much, uh,
Right,
yeah.
it's, it's kind of hard not to be a Cowboy fan, though.
Uh-huh.
They've always been, you know, my favorite.
Right.
But, uh, and and I guess I still have a soft spot.
Yeah.
I just hate that that's the coach that's leading them.
Right.
Right.
So, now have they,
they're in the playoffs, right?
Yeah,
they made it to the playoffs finally
like just, you know, two years ago they were one and fifteen.
They won like just one game
and so pretty fast turnaround.
But this year they made it to playoffs
and today was the first game
and they beat the Chicago Bears
so everybody's really going crazy, you know, down here.
I'll bet they are.
They're going crazy,
so, so they turned it around,
but, you know, they have a lot of young exciting players now, uh,
I mean, everybody was real upset, you know, when they fired Tom Landry,
but, you know, now it's like, you know, they're doing good so everybody's forgotten about that.
Uh, football fans are probably the most fickle people in the world.
Uh-huh.
Hit a bad season
and it's, you know, the coach's fault,
let's, let's dump him.
Right.
First good season, the coach can do no wrong.
Right,
exactly. You know.
But they Dallas has always been good ahead, you know, heading good players and both running, running backs and, and defense.
Uh-huh.
Right,
yeah,
uh, you know, they have a young team.
It's, you know, a lot different than the teams they used to have where it's the same old, you know, players every year and, you know, same coach, same everything,
so, now it's, you know, like a taste of something different.
They're all not, you know, mister nice guys like they used to be.
Now it's like, you know, tough and dirty team
so everybody is really excited.
And,
Who is the competition going to be?
Well, it's supposed to be the Redskins, but you know, we beat them already.
We beat them this year in, in Washington
so, you know, so everybody has the feeling like we can go all the way to the Super Bowl,
but, you know, it's just that we have to play every game away, you know,
it's going to be tough,
but, but
the competition is, are teams that they've already beat this year,
so, I mean, Atlanta, they're in it, too,
and we beat them
and, uh, see, Detroit, we play them next week,
but, you know, we should beat them.
Everybody feels like we should be able to beat them
so, it's, so everything's, uh, looking real good.
Course, I think, you know, you can't really go by what happened earlier in the season injuries that heal
Uh-huh.
Right.
and, you know it can be a or injuries that, uh, have newly happened and it could be almost a totally new team out there than the one we played.
Right.
Right.
Yeah,
well the Cowboys are on a roll.
They've won, like, I think six or seven in a row now,
so they're supposed to be the hottest team in the, in the league going into the playoffs
so,
But, but since you have an O U drop out as a quarterback,
Right,
yeah,
Troy Aikman,
he got hurt at O U,
so he transferred to U C L A.
Well, Well, he, he really didn't feel like he'd be able to do a lot of passing at O U.
Right.
O U has always been known for their running game.
Uh-huh.
More than,
They're playing tonight in fact.
Right.
I'm watching them on T V right now.
But they're doing some stomping on Virginia.
Oh, I tell you,
they've, they've not had much of a team this year, bless their little hearts
Really?
Well, they're doing good tonight.
Are they?
Yeah
I haven't been watching.
they're winning. They're winning forty-one to seven.
Well, good for us
Yeah.
Right.
Oh.
But, yeah,
and, uh, that's right,
Aikman did go to O U.
I forgot about that.
Yeah,
they
then he went out to S, to southern Cal.
Is that where he went?
Yeah,
uh, U C L A.
Yeah.
Yeah.
So,
But, the Cowboys did good today.
I mean, I was proud.
I thought, I thought they would get beat today because, I mean they're so young, you know,
playoffs,
