A|Okay,|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
A|well, I, I, I guess if I was having a dinner party I, depending on the number of people, I might cook a, like a brisket or a roast or a, maybe a chicken dish|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and, um, I guess I usually plan probably a lettuce salad and a, a potato dish,|sd
A|and we usually serve fresh fruit and, uh, then make a dessert.|sd
B|Oh, that sounds good.|ba
A|So that makes,|%
B|Uh, we're not, uh, real wealthy at the moment.|sd
B|Last time I had people over for dinner we had lasagna,|sd
B|and I used my mother's recipe,|sd
B|I really like it.|sd
B|It's got, um,|%
B|you cook the noodles and make, and brown hamburger and put tomato sauce in with it|sd
B|and, I'm not sure she even puts,|sd
B|must be some Italian spices in there.|sd
B|I can't remember.|sd
B|But, um, for the cheese part, you mix, uh, sour cream, and cream cheese and cottage cheese and, uh, layer all that.|sd
A|Well, that sounds good.|ba
B|It's good.|sd
A|That sounds good.|ba
B|And, then, uh, uh, tossed salad and, and, um, someone in the Oh,|sd
B|my goodness, Diane, get down from there.|t3

B|what else did I serve with that.|t1
A|Bread, do you have bread to go with it?|qy
B|Corn,|sd
B|yeah,|b
B|I made French bread with that one too.|na
A|Gosh.|ba
B|I have a recipe that's pretty good for that|sd
B|So.|%
A|Oh, well, lasagna's always wonderful for large crowds.|sv
B|Yeah.|b
A|I've heard, you know, I've heard a lot of people say, it, the short cut on the cooking for lasagna,|sd
A|they, they've told me that they go to Sam's and buy a great big pan of lasagna.|sd
B|I've heard that Sam's has a really good lasagna|sd
A|So.|%
B|in fact I think I had it at a, at a party once.|sd
A|Did you?|bh
B|It was good.|sd
A|Well, I, I know people that have, have served it|sd
A|and they say, gosh, if you have company coming when you don't want to be always in the kitchen, it's easy,|sd
B|Easy|^2
A|and she said it's, they said it's good.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|So, that, that's always sounds good to me, um,|ba
B|Yeah.|b
A|I feel like, I feel like I'm in the kitchen cooking a lot.|sd
B|Oh, I know.|ba
A|I cook, guess I cook a, seems like I cook a lot of dinners, oh, not always for company, just for, just for family.|sd
B|Oh, yeah.|b
A|So, feels like I'm often in the kitchen.|sd
B|Not my favorite place, but. A necessity|sv
A|But a time consuming place.|^2
A|Yeah,|b
A|right,|b
A|right,|b
A|so.|%
B|Let's see,|^h
B|what else do we like to have for,|t1
B|trying to think what else I like to serve.|^h
B|My mother likes to serve taco grandes.|sd
B|Have you ever had,   that?|qy
A|I don't know,|no
A|what that is.|sd
A|No|nn
A|I don't know what that is.|sd
B|You take a flour tortilla|sd
B|and you fry it like a taco shell|sd
A|Okay.|b
A|Right.|b
B|and you, uh,|%
B|for all the inside parts you brown hamburger and put some, um, tomato sauce in it,|sd
B|and, and I like to just add picante sauce to get the Mexican flavor|sd
B|so you don't have to mess with spices and stuff.|sd
A|Right.|b
B|And, then, um, let's see,|^h
B|and then, and you heat up refried beans,|sd
B|and you cut up tomatoes and lettuce and grated cheese,|sd
B|and what you do to make it, you take the shell and you spread the beans on first,|sd
B|then you put the meat,|sd
B|then you put the grated cheese,|sd
B|and then you put, um,|sd
B|let's see, what's next,|^h
B|then, and I, I usually put the cut up tomatoes next and then the, um, lettuce,|sd
A|Right.|b
B|and you can put, uh, like guacamole and someone in the|sd
B|Katy, I'm on the phone.|t3
B|Well, get a towel or go change.|t3
B|I'm on the phone.|t3
B|to Um, oh a little sour cream is good and, and chopped olives,|sd

A|Yeah,|b
A|we, we don't make it very often, I guess,|sd
A|but, uh,|%
B|No,|aa

B|Usually when we get avocados my kids just like to eat them plain|sd
A|Oh do they?|bh

B|I just cut slices off|sd
B|and. I like an avocado sandwich, too.|sd

A|Oh, well, we made, I made guacamole that I would take to a pool party across the street the other day,|sd
A|and, and everyone there said they never made guacamole salad.|sd
B|off What you want.|t3
B|to where do they get it?|qw
A|Well, I don't know,|sd
A|I guess they don't have it at home,|sv
B|I can't imagine it would stay fresh long enough to,|sv
B|I guess they just buy it at a restaurant when they eat it at a restaurant maybe.|sv
A|They must, they just said they never had it at home.|sd
A|So I, I was concerned that, I thought, oh, taking this, you know, taking this as a dip, I thought, gosh, you know, sometimes when we have it at home it, it turns dark on the top so quickly,|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|so I just,|%
B|It helps if you, I helps if you leave the pit in it.|sd
A|Oh, does that help?|qy
B|Yeah,|ny
B|if you leave the pit in the bowl with the thing, especially while you're waiting before you serve it.|sd
A|Okay,|b
A|well,|%
B|That's supposed to help keep the, um, keep it from turning brown so quick.|sd
A|Well, I'll have to remember that.|oo_co_cc
A|Well, I just, I, that day I just took extra lemon and just squeezed across the top|sd
A|and it really stayed longer than I ever thought it would,|sd
B|Oh.|b
A|so.|%
B|Oh, that's good.|ba
A|I thought maybe that was the trick.|sd
B|That probably helps, too.|sv
A|Yeah,|b
A|yeah,|b
A|so. Oh, well. I guess we bought a lot of,|sd
A|we've been buying turkey lately, instead of beef,|sd
A|so|%
B|Do you want it?|t3

B|Yeah.|b
B|Yeah|b
A|we buy it,|sd
B|if you get it on sale,|sv
A|Yeah,|b
A|yeah,|b
A|so we bought that|sd

A|and I don't think anybody in my house knows the difference, unless you tell them.|sd
B|Yeah,|b
B|yeah|b
A|Or in,|%

A|Yeah,|b
A|yeah.|b
B|Poultry instead of the beef and pork,|sd

A|I always like dessert|sd
B|One salad that we always like, my sister-in-law always brings to family dinners, is a,|sd
B|I don't know what you call it.|sd
B|Uh, you mix, um, cottage cheese and a package of jello and a thing of, uh, like Cool Whip|sd
A|Right,|b
A|right|b
B|that's good and quick and easy,|sv
A|that's always good,|ba
A|Probably, probably the only family recipe that we, we make and it's really for special occasions is cheese cake,|sd
A|and we take a recipe from my grandmother, you know|sd
