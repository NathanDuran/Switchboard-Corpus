B|Okay,|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
B|I missed a part of it.|sd
B|We're to talk about what, lawns and gardens?|qy
A|Lawn and garden work and what you enjoy and what kind of work you do.|sd
A|I'm, I'm a putterer.|sd
A|I chose that topic because I really like gardening as far as flowers and shrubs and just keeping a pretty yard.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|I, well,|%
B|it's, it's, it's very strange that I got this call because my wife just called me.|sd
B|I was just in the shower after finishing mowing the lawn and, you know, mowing the lawn and removing some old petunias out of the garden,|sd
A|Oh.|b
B|this type of thing is working right in to start planting fall, fall bulbs.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|Uh.|%
A|We've had a late fall|sd
A|it seems like, the weather,|sd
A|in fact today it's really warm,|sd
A|and so many of the summer flowers are still pretty enough that you hate to pull them up,|sd
A|but you know you need to pretty soon.|sv
B|Well, that's the way this was.|sd
B|The, the petunias were really great.|sd
B|Our mums are, are beautiful,|sd
A|Oh.|b
B|Uh, I don't know if we, I don't think we've had a frost up here.|sd
B|I've been, I was down in for a week,|sd
B|so I don't know what happened last week|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|uh, but, uh, it seems like it's, I don't know if it's late.|sd
B|I'm sort of waiting for Indian Summer|sd
B|so I can get a lot of stuff down out here.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|Uh, I, I enjoy it.|sd
B|We came here, we just moved into this, well, we moved in in November and put all, all the landscaping in this, this year.|sd
B|We came from nine years in a condo, uh,|sd
B|and working in that condo, you didn't have to do anything you know, unless you really wanted to,|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|so .|%
A|So now you have the chance to really create and, and spread out.|bf
B|Right.|aa
B|You know, I can't,|%
B|this is my third, third house I think, I've owned, um,|sd
B|but, uh, it's interesting, you know,|sd
B|the only problem is that I do quite a bit of traveling,|sd
B|and it sort of gets away from me if you're not with it.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|So, but, uh, I, I enjoy most of it,|sd
B|and about this time of year there is, it starts getting a little old,|sd
B|and I start looking forward to, you know, having other things to do with my .|sd
A|The grass not growing so fast|bf
B|Well, it is, it is for me|ar
B|because I've been doing a lot of fertilizing.|sd
B|We had a terrible summer,|sd
B|we had a drought|sd
A|Oh.|b
B|and, uh, took a lot of watering and a lot of fertilizing,|sd
B|and now it's really growing|sd
B|and I'm trying to establish a good root, root growth you know, for the winter.|sd
A|Um|%
A|ours seems to have slowed down here.|sd
A|We're not having to mow every week religiously|sd
B|Really.|b
A|but we're still fighting bugs, and ready to change some of the, the summer flowers out|sd
B|Uh.|%
A|I still have caladiums that are pretty, which is a surprise this late in the year.|sd
B|Oh, really?|bh
A|Uh-huh.|ny
B|Um.|%
A|But like today, it's eighty-five degrees|sd
B|Oh, yeah|b
A|it's really strange,|sd
B|yeah,|b
B|I hear that from, my brother-in-law lives in Plano,|sd
A|But that'll change real quick|sd
B|Yeah|b
B|Well, he always|sd
A|We'll wish we'd planted bulbs and pansies already.|sd
B|he waits until it gets about seventeen below up here|sd
B|and then he calls us,|sd
A|Oh, my gosh.|ba
B|yeah|b
B|it's seventy degrees here in the sunshine.|sd
B|So|%
A|Well, Texas has gotten to where it's a real problem as far as plants, because our summers are so terribly hot|sd
B|.|%
A|and we have ice storms every year.|sd
A|And there just aren't that many plants and shrubs that can take both of those extremes.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|Some of the things that used to be hardy are getting to where they don't make it through the two swings.|sd
B|Yeah,|b
B|that is,|%
B|I was, you know, I was like conditioned to it|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|they, they have to be hardened to it|sd
B|that's, that's strange with me.|sd
B|You know, you think, Dallas, you know, almost semitropical, you wouldn't have that kind of, that kind of problem,|sd
B|but,|%
A|Well, for the most part we don't,|sd
A|but we have usually just a pocket of really bad hot and really bad cold.|sd
A|Well, the summers have gotten where they're a lot hotter|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|but the, the ice storms really are stressful on all the, the plants that we have around.|sd
A|We've noticed that crepe myrtles don't do as well as they used to and, uh, pittosporum|sd
B|Really,|b
B|oh do they.|bh
A|that used to be the kind of things we could plant all the time|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|you, you really take a chance with them freezing,|sd
B|I love,|sd
B|Yeah,|b
B|I love the, uh, the landscaping,|sd
B|like I say, my brother-in-law . I get to Carrollton quite a bit.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|I go there on business,|sd
B|and I really enjoy getting around and seeing the different areas with different gardens,|sd
B|and Texas is,|sd
B|Dallas is very nice.|sd
B|I really enjoy it there. The landscaping, the homes, the architecture, the whole thing very enjoyable gardens,|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and my wife and I,|sd
A|Except for the lack of trees, out where we are  It was all cotton fields,|sd
B|Well.|%
A|and when we get to other parts of the country where the trees are so beautiful, we really miss it.|sd
B|Yeah,|b
B|that we have, you know|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|Ohio's a very pretty state.|sd
B|We moved, in seventy-six we moved to Chicago,|sd
B|we lived there for five years,|sd
B|and I remember the first time I took my wife there on a house hunt,|sd
B|uh, we were coming in|sd
B|and before the plane landed she looked out the window|sd
B|and she said, she said, there's no trees down there.|sd
B|this is Illinois,|^q
B|you're not.|^q
B|And, when we got out to the area where we decided we were going to live and buy a house, there were no trees because the farmers had cleared all the land|sd
A|Um.|%
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and now all of a sudden it was being developed,|sd
B|and the first thing I did was planted all kinds of trees,|sd
