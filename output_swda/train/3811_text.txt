So you have a child Uh-huh.
Yeah
we,
Two year old daughter in child care
and we went through the process of searching for child care and uh, finding what we consider to be, real good child care at a, uh, pretty reasonable price, we think.
Uh,
How about you,
do you have any children?
Yes,
our first
and he just turned three months.
Oh, boy.
So, we're just starting into hunting for child care.
Yeah.
Right now, both of us are students.
Are you?
Where are a student?
Uh,
Uh, University of Southern Mississippi.
No kidding.
Uh, she's,
I was a professor in a university here in California for a while.
Yeah.
Yeah,
uh, are you going to, uh, put your son in child care in a, a year or two?
Uh, probably. Uh,
actually spring semester a year from now he's going to have to be in child care uh, five days a week more than likely. Uh, depending on how my class schedule runs
Yeah.
because my wife will be doing her internship that semester.
Uh-huh.
It will be forty hour week, not, no, eight to five type of thing.
Yeah.
So depending on what my class schedule looks like, he may spend four, anywhere from four to eight hours a day in child care at that point.
Right now we're trying to avoid it,
but we just, as a matter of fact just yesterday hired a, a girl to, uh, watch him.
Uh, I get out of class at certain time
and my wife is already supposed to be on her way to her class. You know,
once a day this overlap happens where we can't, one of us be home.
Yeah.
Yeah.
So for about twenty twenty, thirty minutes a day we got a baby-sitter comes in.
Well, that's a good experience, I think,
and, uh, there are a lot of things to think about
and the articles that are written on the topic, are pretty good
and they kind of boil down to, uh,
any other important decision you really have to explore the alternative
Uh-huh
and what we found, uh, to be the best guide was our own instincts about, people who were going to be loving
Yeah.
and, uh, that's more important than anything else.
We could have sent, uh, her to a fancier, uh, facility.
Uh-huh.
Uh, she goes to a home.
This is a, uh, a couple, uh, emigrated from China early in, in their lives.
Uh-huh.
They've been here probably thirty, forty years.
Yeah.
They've got three daughters.
Uh, and, they have a loving home
and, uh, they're both there
and they have a kid that comes in and helps them in the afternoon.
Uh-huh.
And our daughter is healthy, happy, well adjusted and enjoys going to see her friends,
Yeah.
so it's a good experience.
Uh, that makes a big difference.
I
if it's good,
I think it's very good for the child.
Yes.
And if it's, a loving environment, I think it's very good
and, and that's really what we've learned about it.
She'll have to go on to something more stimulating in terms of preschool in a year
Yeah.
but, uh, we feel real fortunate
and we were able to, uh, just, uh, choose in the marketplace.
I don't know what it's like around, uh, Hattiesburg.
There's a lot of child care available, but invariably there's waiting lists.
Uh-huh.
Yeah.
And we were a little slow getting on the waiting list with the, uh, okay, the university, uh, university's, uh uh, department of, uh, uh, their Home Ec Department
Yeah.
I'll bet they're involved.
Yeah.
uh, they, uh, they have a subbranch, uh, American Family Counseling
and their people staff this, this, uh, the child care center just off campus.
But, uh, they have a pretty good size waiting list.
Yeah
So,
Well, that's, uh,
I know it's, it's a real hard thing to do, even for people in, in, uh, university communities.
Uh-huh.
Out here at Manford, they have a, you know, a, a, a real good facility
and there, uh, is quite a waiting list to get into that.
Yeah.
So it's, uh, uh, you know, it's a, it's a, it's an important, decision,
it's an industry that's still a cottage industry
Yeah. Yeah,
and I think this is  really  is buyer beware.  Well, it is the best way  to do it, interestingly.
a cottage industry's the best way to do it really,
because if you over,
I think that, uh, my own interest in, in development, human development leads me to believe that that's a good sign and that, uh, private enterprise is the way to go and that it will lead to a fundamental change in the way we learn.
Uh-huh.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Because, I think what we're going to go to is much more commercial entrepreneurial learning ventures in the market.
As a matter of fact, my future is banked on that, uh, professionally because I believe that, that there are, uh, pressing needs in the marketplace, unmet by schools, colleges universities for, uh, learning a lot of things that kids can learn watching Sesame Street and in child care.
Uh-huh.
Primary skills which turn out to be the most important skills in life.
Yes.
And it's amazing how much good things like, uh, Sesame Street will do.
It's, it's phenomenal.
It's phenomenal, the programming, the human operating system,
