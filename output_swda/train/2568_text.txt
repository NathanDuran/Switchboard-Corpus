Okay.
Okay.
What's, what's your most recent one that you've seen?
Well actually, what I do,
I haven't been to a movie theater in probably eight or nine months,
Uh-huh.
so  I haven't really seen any movies in the movie theater
but I rent probably four or five movies a week.
Really,
I used to do that too,
but I haven't been doing it lately
but,
We've got a good video place out here
and, uh, uh, oh gosh, uh, I'm just trying to think of all the movies I've recently seen. Uh,
oh, AIR AMERICA.
No,
see, I haven't seen that one, uh.
Have you seen WILD ORCHID?
No,
is it good?
Well, it depends,
do you like, uh, steamy movies
Uh, no,
not
I know that sounds funny coming from a woman,
but usually I don't
Oh, okay,
what type of movies do you like?
Um, action

I, I  guess one of my favorite, well two of my favorite movies is probably like LETHAL WEAPON and LETHAL WEAPON TWO.
Okay.
And those are, those are like two of my most favorite,
I mean they're just really good movies.
And I liked BIRD ON A WIRE. And movies like that.
Yeah.
Do you like suspense movies
or do you like, uh, just action
or,
Um, yeah,
some, I guess like,
what do you mean
like, like are you talking about movies  like DIE HARD TWO.
Oh, JAGGED EDGE,
Okay,
yeah,
I liked that,
that was pretty good.
Um, that was okay,
I, I don't, I guess I thought it was too far fetched
but so many people said oh, no it wasn't, you know.
But I guess,
Oh, well I hope I don't run across them.
Really,
that's true because,
I don't know,
I just didn't find that one to be real,
I, I just thought it was too far fetched.
What was your favorite all time movie?
Um, oh gosh, I I can't think off my head.
Do you know which one yours was?
I, I have to say that probably the one movie that really threw me back the most, uh, that I was really the most in shock with was probably, uh, STAR WARS.
Oh, yeah,
well that's,
When that first came out, I really did not expect the special effects or anything like that.
Right.
I  mean, I guess, uh, out of all the movies, I've, I've never been as excited to go back.
I was ready to go back and see it again, you know
Really.
Yeah,
yeah,
you're right about that,
but that that's really like an all time classic.
I mean, I don't think anybody, anything could ever beat that.
Now, I, I also liked, uh, oh, GONE WITH THE WIND or some of the classic, like THE LAWRENCE OF ARABIA
See, I've never seen that.
Oh, you haven't?
No,
should I rent it?
Oh, yeah.
Should I go rent it tomorrow
No,
that's, uh, that's a, that's a real interesting movie
and it's got a good historical perspective to it.
That's probably something I need to see right now because I'm taking history in school
Oh, yeah.
Actually, I just saw a movie, uh, called THE LOST CAPONE.
And it's about Al Capone's brothers. Primarily one of his brothers,
Oh, really.
and I won't give the, the whole plot away
but it's, it's really a good movie. Uh,
Al Capone had three brothers,
Uh-huh.
and  one of them was lost for many, many years
and, uh, he actually, he turns out to be a law man.
Really.
Yeah,
it's really interesting
it,
Oh, you just gave it away,
I guess I can't go see it
no.
No,
that's okay,
I didn't give away the whole thing,
I just gave away just enough to get you interested
That does sound good,
is it one,
I guess it's a rental.
Yeah,
it is.
Okay,
I may have to do that. Go see it,
or go rent it.
And, a lot of times, what I wind up doing is, picking say an actor or an actress,  and  seeing like all,
Yeah.
I've seen all of James Dean's movies.  Uh,  all of Mae West's movies.
Uh-huh.
And, just kind of, kind of go out and, uh, rent all the movies and, uh, uh, you know, just kind of go,
I guess you could do that, you know, get all of David Carradine's movies,  or,  uh, uh, Segal,
Uh-huh.
to,
what's his first name.
I can't remember his first name.
Um, it's not David is it?
Is it David Segal.
I don't know,
he was on, uh, on, uh, uh, Arsenio, just recently.
Oh, I don't, I don't watch that
Um,
It was really kind of interesting because,  Arsenio  was asking him about, uh, what he thought of, uh, one of the other action guys.
Really.
God, I can't even remember the name.
He said well, he wouldn't really talk about it.
Didn't want to talk about him because he didn't think he was such a, uh, a good action guy.
Huh.
It wasn't Stallone,
it was, uh,
I can't remember.
Shoot, I can't remember the guy's name.
But I like all the, the RAMBO movies.
Oh, see, I didn't really care, that's, that's one side of the action I guess that I didn't really care for
but see I don't really like Sylvester Stallone.
Yeah.
I don't think he's really a very good actor.
I know that sounds awful because so many people think he's so wonderful
but I just have never been a Stallone fan.
Yo, Adrian
Hey that's pretty good.
No,
I guess like I say,
I just have, I don't know, I just have never seen any interest in him,
but.
No,
we, we actually rent, uh, probably a good combination of movies with the exception of horror films.
Oh.
Don't watch really very many horror films at all.
Yeah,
I don't either
You know, I don't know,
there's something about people coming up through the sofa to get you, or something, you know,  coming out of the  T V that just doesn't make my day, you know.
Yeah,
you're right.
Well it's so,
I guess, I'm a real, I'm a realist, and so, when I watch movies like that, it's like this can not happen.
So, I just don't enjoy it, you know, because it's just like, come on, give me a break.
Yeah.
You  know, I mean, I just
and so many of them are done so poorly,
Yeah.
you know that, it just doesn't even give you the effect,
I mean some of them are done good
and they do scare you.
But, um, so many of them are just done real,
I don't know,
I'm not really into those.
I just saw, uh, uh, a really interesting movie called, uh, FLATLINERS.
Oh, that was one of my favorites,
yes.
I thought that was a very good movie.
Yeah.
I was really impressed with that one.
I mean it was, what I liked about it was that it was a new subject.
Nobody had ever touched it before.
Yeah.
You know, and it was just, it was done so well, you know,
it was just,
It was just crazy enough for
you know students might try to do it.
You know, I mean, and it's not like there's a lot of scientific data on it.
Right,
well that's probably true
But it was a very good movie.
It was done real well too.
I mean there wasn't any part of it that you really felt like, no, this can't happen.
It seemed it seemed real,
you know it was really good.
Yeah.
That, that was one, I mean
it's not my all time favorite movie
but it was good,
it was really good.
Yeah.
And, um, I don't know if you like this kind,
but I thought PRETTY WOMAN was a really good movie, too.
Oh, yeah,
that was a great movie.
Yeah,
I've, we've seen that two or three times.
We waited
and we rented it,
Yeah.
you  know, but, but it was really good.
Uh, have you seen SHRIMP ON THE BARBY ?
No,
I haven't,
I don't know if I've even heard of that one.
yeah,
it's got,
It must have, uh, what's his name in it.
No.
No
it doesn't,
No.
Really.
Uh, Hogan?
Yeah,
Paul Hogan.
No,
No,
really,
I'm surprised.
no
it's got, uh,  uh, Cheech Marin .
Oh really, that must be pretty good then,
was it good.
Yeah,
it is,
it's kind of, uh, kind of a poor man's PRETTY WOMAN in reverse.
Oh
But it was kind of cute.
Actually did you see DIRTY ROTTEN SCOUNDRELS?
Yes,
yes.
I though that was a really cute movie,
I enjoyed that.
Yeah,
it was.
TWINS was good too,
because when I thought of that, I thought of,
anyway.
Um, oh, there was another one,
what's the one that just,
oh, DANCES WITH WOLVES, have you seen that yet?
No,
I haven't.
Oh, you've got to see that one,
it's really,
I hear that's the one that you really need to see at the theater instead of home video
Right,
that's probably true,
that's probably true.
It's, it's very, very good. Very good.
Yeah.
That's  another one that,
I was really glad when it won all those awards because it really deserved it.
Well my wife, uh, has got a, uh, a picture from Kevin Costner
and he signed it.
It's from DANCES WITH WOLVES.
Really.
Yeah,
and he signed it.
He, he happens to be, uh, a friend of one of her, her business associates. And, or, not, not a friend, a cousin, a cousin.
Oh, wow, that's impressive.
Oh, neat.
So, uh,  uh, but anyhow we got, uh, we got a nice, uh, picture
and it came in an envelope that says DANCES WITH WOLVES
so we've got to, uh, try to get out there and see that one.
Oh, yeah,
it's really worth it.
I mean it's a very good movie
and yes,
I would suggest seeing it at the theater.
I know that they're still playing it
and they pushed it back, to playing it in the theaters until like August,
Huh.
I, think because they were, they were scheduling a video release of it in July
and then when it won all those awards, uh, they pushed it back to August,
so. But, yeah,
that one is definitely worth seeing,
it's really good.
Now did you see, uh, DRIVING MISS DAISY?
Yeah,
and you know, I didn't think that one was near as good.
Okay.
You know, I guess it was okay,
I mean it was all right,
but, um, when I compare like the winners of this year and last year, it just,
I don't know.
Maybe, it's, it's not,
