All right.
Do you have a bunch of factories and stuff out there?
Um, we've got quite a few, actually.
What we're more concerned with is the inner pollution in the city.
The, uh,
Um, we've actually had some warnings in, uh, Raleigh uh, on air pollution.
Oh, you mean for like smog and stuff?
Uh-huh,
because of there so many cars,
and we have a belt line around Raleigh where we're trying to divert traffic.
Huh.
And, um, you know, it's still, it's just surrounding the city,
and you can actually see it.
There's a couple of, uh, tall buildings in Raleigh,
Uh-huh.
and, and you can actually, you know,
they're blurred,
they're even dark,
and what it is is the pollution.
Huh.
What do you think of that, uh, the greenhouse effect that's going on?
Well I guess that's the fluorocarbons
Yeah
and, uh,
that's causing the hole in the ozone.
Uh-huh.
Yeah,
that's very serious.
I mean, we can, we're even feeling the effects of the weather from, uh, uh, the shift in the jet stream.
Uh-huh.
It, it is scary though, isn't it?
Oh yeah.
I mean, uh, the last two, uh, years, our winters have been absolutely nothing.
Right.
I mean, maybe, one snow.
Well, all right,
North Carolina.
That's up there by Kentucky, isn't it?
Kentucky?
Uh-huh.
Uh, North Carolina is all the way on the east coast.
Okay.
It's further west than Georgia,
it's, uh, right below Virginia.
Okay.
Well, Kentucky's next to Virginia, I'm pretty sure.
Well, I'm from Kentucky,
I should know
but, I don't,
I'm sorry.
But Kentucky, we use to have severe, I mean, just real cold, cold winters
Uh-huh.
and we'd have three and four feet of snow.
Course here in Texas they don't have snow,
they don't know what snow is.
They freak out when there's snow on the ground
Uh-huh.
Originally I'm from Texas
so, I mean Amarillo.
So, uh,
Oh, Amarillo?
Uh-huh.
Well that's close to here.
Yeah,
real close.
How long have you been in Raleigh?
Um, I've been out of Texas about ten years.
Well, how old are you?
Oh, twenty, uh, seven.
I almost forgot my age.
Okay.
Well, we're the same age.
Oh, really?
Yeah,
I forget my age all the time,
so that's okay.
It's, I think it's just something that goes with the territory.
Um
But to me, Texas, see and Kentucky, we had to have ice on the ground for them to close school.
Okay?
Uh-huh.
In Texas, I'm serious, if it gets cold and it looks like it's going to rain, I, I swear they close everything down.
I just laugh.
I mean, I do,
they get, I mean,
and traffic slows down to nothing.
Actually, they've been doing the same thing here.
It's, you know, it's kind of funny,
they, um, I guess northerners are different,
but even, uh, North Carolinians, they don't know how to handle cold weather.
Oh, well, no
I'm from the north,
that's why I said we, in Kentucky, we,
I don't know,
you just get used to the weather,
and of course the people down in south, they they're not used to cold weather and stuff,
and, uh, it just,
Uh-huh.
I don't know,
I just laugh
every time they have a, every time they have snow, on the ground everything's closed up.
And you know, you can have snow on the ground and not be slick on the road
That's true.
But, uh,
Do you all have much pollution there?
No,
not really,
I mean, not to see it.
Now of course, there's, you know, T I is here, Oscar Mayer
Uh-huh.
and there is a few factories,
but I don't see much pollution going on.
Well, you know, what irks me is these cars that are driving down the road,
Uh-huh.
and you have that black smoke coming from their tail pipe.
Well, see, they have that, um, what is it a test, or something like that they call it.
Uh-huh.
And, uh,  that's supposed to cut down on it.
Well,
supposedly that's supposed to catch it.
But I'll tell you what,
and even these buses, oh lord, it real bad. These buses in Raleigh,
Yeah,
school buses and the commercial buses,
Oh, yeah.
yeah.
I mean, school buses are notorious.
Well, they're burning that diesel fuel is what it is.
Oh, yeah,
yeah.
And, uh, it, it gets bad.
Well, you know what they've started doing is, is instead of the tail pipes being at the bottom of those buses they've started putting them up at the top,
Uh-huh.
and that way it gets above, um, other cars on the road
Well, that's a good idea.
and, uh, it really does make a difference, although it, it settles, you know,
even if it's at the top and it's a lot of black smoke coming out, it still settles,
and, and, you know, if you're going to be jogging on the side of the road, that's, that's even more miserable.
I would, I'd have to go out to the country to jog.
Well, uh, the, you know, pregnant women aren't supposed to walk along a highway because of that smoke fumes.
No,
I didn't know that.
When I was pregnant with my first little boy, I had read it,
because back then because I was walking back and forth,
well not back and forth,
I was walking home from, uh, the college I was going to in Kentucky.
Uh-huh.
And I was having to walk along the highway.
It was just one day a week.
But it was, in,
I, I have no sense of smell,
so I couldn't smell this,
but it would make me sick,
and I'd be real tired anyway just from walking along the highway.
Um.
Uh-huh.
Golly, that's, that's bad.
But,
yeah,
it's,
yeah,
all the exhaust. Uh,
well, that was four years ago, too,
it's probably a lot worse now.
Oh, I'm sure.
Yeah.
Well, they, um, you can really feel it, you know, in your breathing, even normal people,
and if you're older, um, I mean, you can really deplete your oxygen,
and it'll, you know, pass out,
Uh-huh.
and it's, you know, it's killed several people.
Do you, uh, smoke?
Um, actually, I'm a very, I just smoke one in the evening if that.
So, I'm a very, very light smoker.
yeah,
it's kind of
It was kind of funny.
They were doing some, uh, ozone testing, and, uh, the E P A
and they were just screening some candidates,
and I don't think I'd ever, you know, do that,
but they, uh, asked me if I was a smoker,
and I didn't fit into the smoker's category,
and I didn't fit into the nonsmoker's category. Um,
it was, you know, I was just one of those
Yeah,
because you do smoke one a day.
yeah,
in between people.
So that kind of threw them off.
Um. Uh,
But they're doing a lot of research here, uh, the E P A
For the air pollution.
For ozone, and oh, yeah, all that.
They're, they're real big into it.
They've got Research Triangle Park here,
and they're, you know, they're just doing a lot of, uh, lot of stuff.
Huh.
But, they,
I don't hear much about it down here.
Course, Texas, we don't have a bunch of pollution.
Huh-uh.
But, too, we've got that air coming in off the coast.
Oh, uh-huh.
And you know it'd blow it up north.
Uh-huh.
So, maybe that's part of the reason it's not so bad down here.
Uh-huh.
But, no
it would seem like it would be the same way in, on the California coastline, wouldn't it?
Oh, gosh, I think I would hate to live in California, the smog there.
Uh-huh.
I mean, I can't believe they have warnings here, which it, it's mainly just when it gets real, real hot.
Uh-huh.
But they usually have that everywhere because of the humidity especially.
Really?
well that's kind of good to know,
because I thought lord, I thought I lived in a halfway decent area.
I think they do that for most everybody.
Um.
especially, it's usually for the young children and the older, the old people older old people.
Uh-huh.
Well you ought to come to North Carolina.
It's a big change
It is?
Yeah.
There was no trees where I was from, in Amarillo,
and here they've got the mountains, the beach, the trees, you know,
it's they've got streams, rivers, ponds,
Oh.
it's really pretty here.
Oh, well, this is pretty wooded area down here
so,
Is it?
in a lot of parts,
yeah.
I know Texas is supposed to be flat,
but they've got, you know, down by the Denison Dam there's a lot of, uh,
Uh-huh.
Sherman and Denison,
do you know my grandparents live in Durant?
They do?
Yeah.
They live close then.
Yeah,
real close.
I go there,
In Durant, Oklahoma?
Yeah.
You go where? Uh,
you go to visit them?
Oh, uh-huh.
Oh.
Yeah,
we used to go fishing in Lake Texoma.
Yeah,
well, down by Lake Texoma there's a bunch of wooded area.
This,
but, but Kentucky's beautiful.
They've got trees,
and trees are supposed to, you know, purify.
You know what the best indoor purifying plant is for smoke and stuff?
huh-uh.
It's a philodendron.
Oh, really?
It's supposed to filter the air for you, in your home.
Well, I'm going to have to get some.
I had one.
My husband bought it for me when my daughter was born three months, four months ago.
Uh-huh.
Do you smoke?
Yeah,
I do.
Do you?
Yeah,
I do.
Did you smoke when you, when you were pregnant?
Yeah,
I did.
I couldn't make myself quit.
Well.
I did cut down a lot
I mean I can understand that, actually.
I got, I, I've got one vice
and smoke is, smoking is it.
Well,
I don't, I don't drink,
and I try not to cuss,
and I do, I do very little,
and smoking, I just, I got in the habit of it when I was about thirteen.
Yeah.
Well, one thing I miss is, uh, is the people from Texas, are, are, you know,
I miss their morals, their values and everything.
It's, uh,
Yeah,
we're down here at the Bible belt, aren't we?
Uh, I wasn't saved until I got down here,
and people down here are just,
there's so many Christians,
and it's so different from Kentucky
but,
Uh-huh.
How'd you get involved in this research?
Um, I worked at T I for a while,
but then my brother-in-law works there,
and he got me into it.
Oh, I see.
Huh.
How'd you get into it?
Um, I, I was taking a voice I O class and, um, and actually doing some research,
and so they told me about this project.
Well, it's fun,
I like talking to new people.
Uh-huh.
And I, half the time, well a couple of times I've been interrupted by my little girl,
I've had to hang up and stuff.
Uh-huh.
But I enjoy it.
I talked to people from, well, what, Carolina now up in, uh, Boston, and New York,
Uh-huh.
well Boston is New York, isn't it?
No.
Uh, no,
Boston's above.
Boston, Massachusetts
Uh-huh.
But I've talked to people in New York,
but I've talked to a lot of people in Texas,
because I guess, it's because T I down here.
Yeah,
I've talked to a lot of people in Texas.
I had one call actually from Charlotte, North Carolina, and Virginia, and, um,
I can't remember where all.
From up north, like you said,
I think one was from Boston.
With Boston, I love their accent
I do,
I love the Boston accent.
I met a girl from Boston one time.
My husband was in the service,
so we went from Kentucky to Louisiana down here to Texas,
Uh-huh.
and his family's down here.
Uh-huh.
We're out of the service now.
Oh, I bet you're glad.
Yeah,
he got out of it, his unit, right after Panama.
We went to he went to Panama when Noriega was doing all that.
Uh-huh.
Oh, gosh.
And, uh, he ...
