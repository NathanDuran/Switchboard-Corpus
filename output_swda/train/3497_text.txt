So, how is the weather out there?
Uh, it's really cold
and it's supposedly for this time of the year it's unseasonably cold
and they've gotten more snow than they've ever had.
Oh, really?
You have, breaking records for coldness and all that kind of stuff.
How about you guys?
Um. Uh, it's just, it's a, it's about same.
The usual, I think.
Oh.
So, nice for skiing and all that kind of stuff
It's good.
Yeah,
well the weather, let's see, well, the snow here is different from Utah's,
because I have lived in Utah for like ten years.
Oh, really?
What part?
And, uh,
Provo.
I was going to B Y U.
Oh, really?
Okay.
Yeah.
And, uh, the snow is like, really cold.
I mean, it's, like, really humid
so it seems wetter or something like that.
It's,
It's more humid in Utah than there?
Uh-huh.
Or there?
It's more humid in Iowa than Utah.
Okay.
Right.
Yeah.
Okay.
And it seems like when the winds blow, it's really, it goes right through you.
It's really different from Utah's weather.
I thought Utah was cold,
but I think Iowa is a lot colder
Yeah,
see, that's how it is in Texas, too
because when it's cold, it's really cold.
So,
Yeah,
I don't think there is any mountains to stop the wind
What's that?
I don't think there is any mountains to stop the wind.
Right.
Yeah.
So the humidity is I think what does it
Yeah,
I think that's true.
Because I, I noticed when I got here, too,
because like I'd,
when it would snow in Texas uh, I would just, I mean we'd be really cold
Uh-huh.
and we'd have to get really warm,
and here you can almost not even wear a coat outside when it's snowing
and you don't you don't feel super cold.
Yeah,
yeah,
that's true.
It was weird.
Yeah.
But, so how long ago did you graduate?
Or did you,
or,
Uh, I graduated in nineteen eighty-seven.
Oh, really?
Yeah,
my husband got his doctorate at B Y U,
so that's,
and so he just graduated this past year.
Oh.
So you just barely moved away?
Uh-huh
Yeah, Well, we really miss Utah
Do you like it out there?
We miss the mountains.
You do?
Yeah.
Because it's, like, really flat here
Well, not flat, but hilly.
But no big mountains or anything.
Uh-huh.
So you just moved away a year ago?
Uh, in August.
Wow, really recent.
Yeah.
But, uh, see, see what else can I say about the weather.
Uh, well, today was warmer
It was like forty-five
Oh, warm
So, what's the temperature up today over there?
Oh, man,
it's got to be like, it's probably fifty, fifty-five, maybe.
Oh, really?
Maybe not that warm.
Probably about, uh,
yeah.
It's not, it's not that cold, really.
And whenever I remembered the weather reports in Utah, I never really remember them talking too much about wind chill.
Yeah.
But they talk about wind chill here all the time.
Yeah,
that's a big deal in Texas, too.
They said it could be, like, six degrees out and, like, negative forty-one wind chill.
Um.
So, that's what we're not used to
Yeah,
that's true.
That makes a big difference. Huh.
So, oh, I,
So, did you used to ski when you were out here?
What's that?
Did you used to ski when you were in Utah?
Oh, I've only, I've only skied in Utah once.
Oh, really?
I only skied once my whole life
But, do you do a lot of skiing there?
Uh, not tons,
but I like to when I get a chance.
Uh-huh.
I've only been once so far, but had the opportunity a couple times since then.
Just saving my money for Christmas things and that.
Yeah.
So is this your first year in Utah?
Uh, no,
this is actually my third year.
And you're going to school there?
Uh-huh.
Oh.
Yep.
At U of U,
or,
No,
at B Y U.
Oh, really?
Yeah.
Oh.
So, but, I'll be here a long time at this rate.
What's your major?
Uh, it was nursing,
but I'm in the process of changing it right now.
Uh-huh,
oh.
Because it's really, really competitive at B Y U.
Yeah.
You have to have like a three seven to get in
so, It's really,
That's true.
I'm going to look into some other fields.
I'd like,
all the science classes and that, I'm just not really enjoying too much
so I think I better get into something that I can enjoy the process of going to school
Uh-huh.
so,
Yeah,
that's, that's a good idea.
Did you graduate in a certain field
or,
Uh, education.
I got a double major.
In,
Uh, elementary and special ed.
Really?
Uh-huh.
That what my sister did.
Oh, really?
Yeah,
you might know her.
Here name is Lori, Bird.
Maybe not
I think she graduated around then, too, though, eighty-seven probably,
but, she got her
Yeah,
well, I can't,
there are so many girls in all my classes,
I can't remember how many people.
Yeah,
yeah.
Because they, since, uh, stopped that program. I mean, where you can where you can get it double pretty easily.
Oh, have they?
Oh.
I mean, it's, it's really,
