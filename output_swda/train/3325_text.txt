Okay,
well, do you have a pet?
I have two cats. And do, and, oh, and two fish.
Two cats,
you're lucky.
Your two fish.
And what do you have?
Well, my husband,
you know, how, sometimes when you marry someone that you get along on everything except one major thing.
Oh, no.
My husband is a hunter, fisherman, outdoorsman, Marlboro type person who had to have a sporting dog.
So we have a black Labrador.
Ooh.
Beautiful, gorgeous black Labrador,
but to me, he belongs up in the field, you know, in the ranch, in the farm
and,
Well, because we finally negotiated that I was losing my mind, uh, he sleeps in the laundry room
and then he goes out for the day.
But this, this is a beautiful dog
and he is wonderful with our little girls
and he is, he's, comes from a purebred line
and there's nothing you could say bad about him, except that I was more of a cat or a small dog person that you could sit in the chair and cuddle.
Right.
Right.
And this is huge.
You know, course, when he runs around the yard, he just digs,
he doesn't know that he's tearing up things,
but he does.
Yeah,
yeah.
And the worst part that I had with him, he's, he's three now was when he was, uh, about eight months old
Uh-huh.
and I did not know what to expect from a dog having not had one,
and I left him in the kitchen with the little baby gates up while I was gone for about an hour.
And I came home
and he had ripped my wallpaper off my wall.
Oh, my word.
And it was in the floor
and I just about lost it
and I called
and I said, come home and get your dog.
And so, he said, well, puppies just chew when they're nervous and I, well, I wish you had told me you know,
Oh, dear.
and it was about eight months later, he ate a piece of the linoleum.
He kept picking at it
and I didn't
the, the tile in the kitchen and picked a hole in it
So the last thing he did was, when I had sat out a whole lot of begonias in the backyard, and he dug them all up and brought them to the porch.
And I told my husband,
I said, you know, it's either me or the dog,
and he looked at me like, well, you know
Good-bye
He loves this dog
and every night when he comes home from work, he hugs it and talks to him
and he's a good dog,
so it's one of those things I'm just having to get used to
and that's why I laughed when they called with the topic.
I thought, oh, boy, do I have a pet
But, I, I grew up with cats
and I'm very comfortable,
I love my cats.
Yeah.
I had one cat for eighteen years.
I got her when I lived in Hawaii.
Oh.
Before I even got married I had my cat.
She's old.
Well, she, I had to have her put to sleep last June.
Isn't she?
Oh, I started to say
then you broke your heart.
Oh, it was awful,
it was just awful.
Oh.
But, and she just sat there on my lap, you know.
Oh.
She just, just waited
and,
Bless your heart.
Oh, it was awful.
That makes me feel so bad.
But her hair,
but the bad thing was, though, she would pee in my husband's shoes.
Yeah.
Oh, no
You know, and she just liked his shoes
and he'd have these dress hundred dollar shoes.
Oh.
Oh, no
Oh, it was just bad.
And my closet
and it was, oh, something.
Oh, that's awful,
I never heard of that before.
Oh, it was terrible.
And once she did it, you know, then she would, I mean, she wouldn't,
if our shoes sat side by side, she would pee in my husband's shoes.
Uh-huh.
She must have known he didn't like her or something.
Or the smell or something.
Oh, anyway, I, I,
and I would shut, I would bar the closet doors, and would uh, clean the carpets
and
Uh-huh.
oh, dear, it was just awful.
Well, now, does your cat sleep in the house?
That was very funny.
They are, they are house cats.
I, uh, well, I have two cats right now.
Yeah.
And, of course.
Oh, yeah,
good.
They sleep with my kids.
My kids, my, my fourteen year old son has an extra pillow on his bed just for the cat.
Oh.
But the cat doesn't destruct does it?
See, it doesn't do anything.
Oh, no, I I'm not going to have a dog.
See.
We've had two dogs
and, uh, they both got ran over. After we had them for several years, just nice little outside dogs
Oh, no.
but
Yeah.
were just my kids' friends,
they would go they would go with me when I would go running
and and the last one got hit, uh, as she was following my, one of my sons across the road to the school.
Oh.
Oh, no.
It was awful.
It was just,
Oh, that is.
And it just, it's too heartbreaking
but they do dig up
and they just, they just wreck things
and I'm not a dog person.
They do wreck things.
Well, I'm not either.
Ooh.
I'm not either
and it's just been,
I wouldn't want a Lab.
It sounds beautiful,
but,
He's beautiful
but it's just one of those concessions, I just had to make,
but I kind of ignore him.
Now today's the first cold we've had in Texas
and it's really cold and drizzly
and it's freezing
Um.
and people are doing their fires
and I brought him in because he's just a wet mess out there
and he's in the laundry room with this little carpet square
and he's just huddled up like, if you'll be nice to me, I won't make any trouble, you know.
And then my daughters both have hamsters.
Oh.
And I, I,
And how old are your girls?
They're eleven and eight
and I gave in at Christmas
Oh, yeah.
and they have, they keep their cages real clean.
It always smells of cedar
and they just sleep and eat bits of apple and carrots and,
Sure.
I think they're cutting us off.
No,
that's
Oh.
somebody's trying to cut in on my line
and I don't want to answer.
Oh, okay.
I'll just wait.
Okay.
No,
I've, I've got incoming calls
and I don't know why, calling.
Oh, okay.
I, I hate to cut it off,
I think they would cut us off,
I understand.
so we'll just wait.
Okay,
well
Whoever it is will call back.
they'll cut us off pretty soon.
Well, it's somebody calling for my kids, you know,
jeez.
Yeah,
I know.
Actually, it's my son,
I know it is.
My older boy. He never likes to come home from school.
Anyway that's what we have,
and I have, I've tried to start a fish tank
How does,
and I keep losing all my fish.
In the salt water?
Salt water or,
No
Yeah.
just regular water.
