Okay,
sorry.
Wow,
that's okay
So, tell me about your home.
Oh, it's, uh, it looks like a little shot gun house, almost.
It's got three bedrooms going along one side and the living room and kitchen on the other.
Uh-huh.
It's, uh, an older home,
it's not new,
I like it though,
it's big.
Oh really,
what kind of square footage?
Oh, I wouldn't know,
I measured it one time,  because  I was, uh, we had saw some termites
Uh.
and we thought about getting it sprayed.
I think it was like,
I can't remember,
I'm sorry
That's okay,
that's okay.
It's big enough for us, though.
Uh-huh.
We  kind of need maybe one more room.
We've got two children.
Uh-huh,
okay.
So where do you live at,
I mean what part of town. In here in Denison.
Okay,
see, that's north.
Or down here in Denison,
yeah.
Okay,
I live, I live in Plano,
so it's north to me
Okay,
up here then
I say down,
I'm really from Kentucky.
I was going to say you didn't have the typical,
you have a southern accent,
Uh-huh.
but  you don't have a Texas accent.
Right.
Well I'm originally from, uh, Ohio, Cincinnati,
Oh, okay.
so I'm  uh, familiar with, uh,
That area,
that dialect.
Right,
right
Also I lived in Georgia for about four years,
so the, uh,
there's a difference too, between east and west, in the south.  And,  uh, the way in which people speak.
Uh-huh.
Anyway, my home is, um, I guess it's about twenty-five hundred square foot
and I have, uh, four bedrooms at the present.
We're busting out walls and things like that.
That's what I want to do.
How many kids do you have?
We have two,
we have two.
Do you have enough bedroom space, then?
Yeah,
we'll have enough bedroom space,
it's,
we're rearranging our house because the bedrooms are kind of small.
Uh-huh.
And so, we're going to enlarge our master bedroom and take out a couple of walls and enlarge it. And then shuffle the rooms around a little bit.
That's kind of like what we'd like to do.
We just had a baby a couple months ago
and we've got a den,
it's more or less a spare room.
Uh-huh.
We rarely go in there, except for to play chess.
Uh-huh.
We want to make that a bedroom for my stepdaughter and my daughter
and, uh, we need the one extra room.
Like, like you said, our rooms are too the bedrooms are too small,
the living room and kitchen are huge,
Right.
but  the bedrooms are too small.
Where you've got to leave the furniture just one certain way, you can't rearrange it at all.
Right,
there's they, uh,
I know what you're saying there,
ours is the same
and they tend to put windows in the strangest places.
Yeah.
You  know we have windows in our bathrooms which really makes it difficult for,
Yeah,
we've got two great big windows in our back bathroom.
Uh-huh,
you're kind of limited in what you can do there and everything,
so.
No privacy.
No,
we don't have a lot of that,
yeah.
Well, we've got at least two windows on every wall in the house.
It,
Uh-huh.
I'd hate to clean these windows,
I really would.
I figured I'm going to have to hire somebody to remove our windows and put new ones in that are easier to clean.
Ours are the double pane
and you can't really clean them on the inside, you know.
Ours are those too,
yeah.
You must live in an older home too then.
Right,
I do,
the house is about, um, I'd say almost thirty years old.
Uh-huh.
So  it's not a new home,
it's, it's seen some wear and tear. You know.
Ours has too.
When we moved in the man that sold it to us had said that he remodeled it,
Uh-huh.
and  he did it hisself,
so most of that, by now, is falling apart.
Oh.
You  know, well I mean, it's not just horrible,
but like this tile's come loose off the wall,
the whole bathroom is covered from ceiling to foot in tile
and I don't like that at all.
Um, that is awful.
With that, uh, the great big tiles, square tiles like, that you put on the floor,  the, the huge one.
Uh-huh,
he did it in that?
Yeah,
instead  of wallpaper.
I wouldn't mind it if it was like short tiles,
for that you put,
The normal tiles,
right.
right
that you put  around a bathtub,
that would be prettier.
Uh-huh.
But  this looks like floor covering on the wall.
It just doesn't look good.
Oh, and also they're very heavy
and so they tend to come off a whole lot easier.
Right,
there's one big one that has come off
and short of putting nails through it, we can't get it back on,
so.
Um.
And he rewired the house
and it's shorting out here and there,
and
Oh, wow,
I,
that's one of the things we've been fortunate with, is our, uh, wiring is okay.
We don't have a, we don't have enough power,
um, or our breakers aren't, aren't powerful enough to take, to, to really help with the load in the house.
Uh-huh.
I  mean we need to redo some, rewiring ourselves
but our plumbing is awful.
There is there is a shut off valve that's outside that doesn't work,
Um.
and  there's no other real shut off valves inside the house,
so if something breaks, we have to shut it off from the main, in the street,  you  know,
Yeah.
and, oh, it's, it can be really bizarre.
Yeah.
And we never know where it's going to flood.
We've got power surges on the west side of our house.
We've got our stereo hooked up.
Uh-huh.
Well that,
the power makes it run.
It's never ran,
it's always ran just fine, the clock and stuff.
Uh-huh.
But it runs about ten minutes fast, except for about a month, for about a month the, the clock ran normal.
Um.
And then the power went off again,
lightning or something knocked it out
and we hooked it back up
and now it's running ten or fifteen minutes fast again.
Um.
But on the east side of the house it runs fine.
Oh boy, you do have a strange wiring problem there.
He put new wiring in,
it's all new wiring up in the attic,  or  I guess crawl space,
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
but, uh, oh, no,
he didn't know what he was doing,
he really should have hired people.
Well that's something,
my husband's in construction
and he won't even touch electrical stuff.
He,
I mean, he'll do a little things
but he won't do any major rewiring.
He  says he'd rather pay the electrician to handle it.
Right,
he'll end up killing himself.
Pardon.
End up killing theirselves.
That's right.
My husband, he'll change out a light switch,
but that's about as far as he'll go.
Well that's the way mine is, you know,
Yeah.
I  mean, he, he well he said he went up in the attic and looked around
and he was like, oh my God,
he says, looks like a bunch of spaghetti up there.
And we had squirrels in our attic when we first moved in because the roof was so sorry,
Uh, was a what,
The roof was really sorry.
I mean when we moved in,  we  had no idea how bad it was.
Uh-huh.
It was a wood shingle roof,
and we,
the first year we were living there, we had to replace the roof.
Well he put,
which
I heard it's a law that you're only allowed to have three layers of shingles.
Is it three or five,
your husband probably knows.
He probably knows,
I don't know what it is off hand.
Well, he's got seven layers of shingles up there,
and he told us it was a completely new roof.
Like I said, he didn't know what he was doing.
Yeah,
he must not of.
We stripped ours, we stripped ours off.
We didn't put it over, 'cause we put composition roof on.
And we completely completely stripped all the old wood shingles off, put decking up, put the paper down, and I mean just started from scratch.
Uh-huh.
Unfortunately when we were doing that it decided it wanted to snow and hail and rain.
Oh, no.
And we, and we had, we had almost, I'd say about half of the roof off,
and it did this.
And, uh, uh, a house full of snow.
And a house full of snow, and rain,
Uh-huh.
and  it came down,
it did this in the middle of the night.
We have plastic, you know, just tied down on everything, you know, as best we could,  real  thick edge stuff, I mean,
Uh-huh.
and the wind came in from the north
and it just blew everything off in the middle of the night
and we were asleep
and, and I woke up
and I got up
and it was about four o'clock in the morning
and I heard all these, these drips, drip, drip, drip, drip, drip, drip.
Oh, no.
I had water coming in every light fixture.
That,
yeah.
I had  water coming in everything that was in the ceiling, everywhere.
And I mean it filled up my light fixtures, because they're the old kind.
Uh-huh.
And  I would go in,
and I'd turn on a light in the room, you know
and the light would come on
and the whole thing would be full of water.
And I mean the light would still come on.
It didn't blow up or anything
My neighbor, or a friend of mine when I lived in Louisiana, her,
we all lived on base,
my husband was in the Army.
Uh-huh.
She woke up about three or four o'clock in the morning, water dripping from hers.
The neighbor's uh, washing machine had uh, over done something,
I don't know
but it was leaking, just pouring water in
and it all went through to her roof
and it was coming out of the lights, fixtures.
Oh.
The fire alarm went off for some reason.
It shorted it out, or something.
Oh, yeah,
that will happen.
So she woke up with about six feet of water in her house.
Oh, my lord.
No,
not six feet
but,
But it's quite a bit, quite a bit,
you know that,
Yeah
you might as well
so. Did you have carpets and stuff?
Oh, several of our rooms got ruined,
we have, um,
we are on pier and beam,
we don't have concrete slab underneath our house,
Uh-huh.
so  it, it got into the carpeting, got into the floor.
The carpeting was already awful anyway,
but it got into the floor and rotted the floor and made it stink
Your house sounds like mine because mine's pier and beam too.
Oh really.
Yeah.
Yeah,
they came in
and they had it,
one room they completely cut up the floor in and removed it.
We had to call the insurance company.
I mean the insurance company was paying for the new roof
but they also ended up having to pay for the damage when the roof was being repaired. You know, which really wasn't our fault.
Uh-huh.
I mean  we'd done everything we could to keep out the weather. You know, and stuff
That's right.
That's right.
and,
Well you got to redo it the way you wanted it in the end.
Oh yeah
it,
Are you finished with it now?
Uh, the roof?
Uh-huh.
Oh yeah,
yeah,
it's, it's been done for quite some time.
We're really glad with all the rain we've had in the last couple of years that we have a really good roof.
Uh-huh,
how long have you lived there?
Uh, see, it's three,
it's just been at three years.
We've been in the house just the three years.
We've been doing a lot of remodeling.
I mean, it's, it had detached, it had a detached garage
and my husband's built a walkway across
and we're going to brick up the garage to match the house and things like that
so we,
You all did it yourselves?
What, uh, the walk?
The home improvements.
Oh yeah,
yeah,
he see he does this for a living,
Uh-huh.
I  mean this is what,
