Are you in the market for a car recently?
Yeah,
I just bought a car.
Oh, what did you get?
I got a nineteen ninety-three Cavalier station wagon.
Uh-huh,
what, what convinced you to get that one?
Well, a friend of my father's, and he'd driven it all over the country and it runs great.
Uh-huh.
Oh, incredible,
how many miles on it?
It's like, it has a hundred and fifty-three thousand.
And it's still running real well.
Yeah.
Oh, great,
yeah.
We have, uh, right now we have two cars, uh,
I have, my husband and myself and we have two sons who are drivers and one of which is a, um, an eighty-eight Plymouth Voyager Van,
Uh-huh.
and then we have, um,
about a year ago, we picked up a second hand, uh, uh, Audi
Uh-huh.
and, uh, that was a you know, a sedan,
and, uh, we got that.
The major things,
the reason why we got that is we had had a Nova,
and a,
well,
my son was driving,
and someone came into his lane and hit him,
and fortunately he was able to,
his,
I mean he was checked out of the hospital, was out of the hospital by that night, but the car was completely totalled
Uh-huh.
and Mike, and, they had been, my two sons had been a passenger in a car about a year and a half before that, which was hit by another car.
Um.
So I mean, I got, I was getting really nervous,
so I finally said, we, I want a really solid car.
So we found the Audi second hand.
I guess right now my criteria for cars is, uh, of being solid, able to take an impact
Right.
and, uh, so, uh, I, we're not going to be in the market for, in the near future for any new car.
Uh-huh
But the things that I would want would be a solid car.
Another thing I'd definitely want would be anti-lock brakes.
Right.
Uh, our, our van, which is a, a delight to drive, does not have,
I think the brakes on the Plymouth van is just, are terrible.
Um.
If the road is at all wet, and I'm,
and I don't go all that fast, but the, uh, it, it just doesn't hold.
It doesn't hold well at all.
So, I, I definitely want to get anti lock brakes.
So, I don't know,
do you have any particular things that, that are priorities on your list.
Well, it's,
I didn't really need power windows, but it has power, you know, windows and steering and air conditioning,
Yeah.
and, and uh.
I guess down here air conditioning's a must, isn't it.
Uh-huh,
oh, yeah.
It has a stereo and a cassette player
Uh-huh.
and, um, he's told me it gets forty-two miles to the gallon.
That's incredible.
Uh-huh.
That is incredible.
So.
Uh, we, we get about, our, the van gets, on highways, can get about twenty-eight.
The Audi does not have good mileage.
That's the one drawback.
It's a powerful car. Um, but it does not, uh,
Uh-huh.
I mean, I, if I'm on a highway and I can get twenty, twenty-one miles per gallon, I consider that I'm lucky.
Maybe, maybe sometimes I've gotten twenty-two.
It comes out around the eighteen or nineteen local driving
Uh-huh.
and that's a, to me is a real drawback.
I wish I would, you know, I could settle for twenty-eight,
but, uh, the, uh, the frills on that car are nice, but they're not necessary, for me except air conditioning.
Uh-huh.
In this area, uh, in Washington D C area, it gets hot and humid.
Uh-huh,
it's really humid.
Yeah,
uh, so air conditioning is uh, definitely a necessity for us through two or three months in the summer.
Um, but I, uh, I, I don't need, uh, you know,
power windows are nice, but I don't need them Although I must say when you're driving in the east and there are all these toll roads, come into a toll road, you just push that button down,
Right.
it's real nice for that window to zip down and zip up, instead of having to crank it.
Crank,
yeah.
Yeah,
but, or, you know, if you want to have open windows, to be able to
if you're alone in the car just to press buttons, and.
Right.
You don't have to stretch.
But you know, I've lived all these years without them,
I probably could have lived a little longer
That's true.
Uh, one of the things that we have, uh, we've liked when we gotten a new car, and this, this used car has it, is a sun roof
Uh-huh.
and those are really nice in good weather.
That's right.
So, so I guess if we get a new car, it definitely would have to have anti lock brakes,
I'd love to get an air bag and a sun roof, and, uh, just so it'd be a good solid car.
Uh-huh.
I guess that those are my major criteria.
Everything else is, you know, a luxury,
and they, make the car more expensive, but they often add more things to repair when things go wrong.
Right.
So, uh, if you were to buy a new car now, a brand new car, what would you look for?
Um, like you said, anti-lock brakes and air bag,
and, uh, I'd, I'd really like to have a car that's dependable that, that you drive, you know, like a American made car that's as dependable as Mercedes or somebody, you know that's,
Yeah,
yeah.
Isn't that true.
It's, it's funny, um, uh, that you use,
the Audi's German, and I have to say, it has been pretty dependable.
Uh-huh.
Yeah,
sometimes, one advantage of an American made car, is if you get stuck anywhere, most local garages can fix you up.
Yeah,
they have parts,
uh-huh.
But once you get, if you, once you get something fancy, you get stuck somewhere off of the main area you can be really,
Right,
and the parts, I know the Audi parts are terribly expensive.
Uh-huh.
I mean, it
I shudder.
I would not get the Audi again, just for that reason.
But I would love, I wish an American, an American, that, you know, engineering would make something as solid as a German car.
You know, we certainly have the technology,
Right.
but, it's amazing,
when we bought this Audi,
I mean, everything is more solid in it.
Right.
Uh, if,
you don't feel you've got any of the flabby plastic
Uh-huh.
and I know,
and I, I, and I'm willing to give up a little bit in the mileage for a solid car.
I don't think I have to give up as much as I'm giving up.
Right.
But, do you need air conditioning down there?
Yes,
we really do
Yeah.
because even today it's supposed to get up into the nineties.
So
Oh, we've had eleven days in a row over ninety.
Uh-huh.
They've in fact had to excuse school down here because of that.
Well, listen,
I enjoyed talking with you.
Okay,
and enjoy, enjoy your car.
Yeah,
have a nice summer.
Thank you,
you too,
it's going to be a hot one.
Yeah.
Okay,
bye-bye
Bye-bye.
