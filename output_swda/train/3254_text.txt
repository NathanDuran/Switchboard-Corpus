Okay.
Where do you enjoy dining out?
Oh, I generally go to the quickie places just because they're cheap.
Yes,
do you have children?
Uh, we have four,
but most of them are gone now
Uh.
so there, there might be,
but we were taking, you know, uh, four, five and six people out
Yeah,
that makes a difference, doesn't it.
Yes.
What area of the country do you live in?
I'm in Texas.
Yes,
I am, too.
But,
And we we lived in Ohio prior to this.
I did, too.
I'm from the Dayton area.
Oh.
Yeah,
uh, but I look for service even at the quickie places type things.
Uh-huh.
Uh, I don't like to go to the drive-thrus because sometimes they get your order wrong
That's right.
and then you're stuck
and it's a pain to have to stand there and see what it is before you leave
Yes.
so I really don't like the drive-thrus that much.
I, I like to go and eat there.
But I would say service, uh, atmosphere, and whether the food is good,
and on going out, I like steaks.
So, we try to hit those places when we can.
When we travel we look for Wendy's because we have kids,
and my husband and I like getting the salads or the lighter meals
Uh-huh.
and then that way they can get their burgers and fries
and we can have a salad bar
Yeah.
so sometimes we drive for a couple hundred miles until we find a Wendy's, because it's all either McDonald's or Dairy Queens,
and, in, in, in the countries, unless it's a large city, I guess Dairy Queen and Wal-Mart are their main
Right,
that's right,
That's what you find,
right,
I know.
My husband likes, uh, Dairy Queens.
He likes their milk shakes and their chili cheese dogs, I guess,
Uh-huh.
so he's a fan of, of Dairy Queen,
and, and we'll go even in town here at times, just as a, a change although I'm not that excited about it.
Uh-huh.
But we've eat, we eat out so much it's gotten so I don't like to really eat any place
but yet I hate to cook food at home
Oh.
so that might be why I look for inexpensive places just because we're eating out probably five nights a week maybe.
Uh-huh.
Um.
Or we eat junk food at home
Yeah.
uh, now my
Well, what are some of your, your favorite inexpensive places?
Oh, we'll go to them all.
We sort of take turns.
And we, uh
I sort of favor the ones,
if I have a coupon we can go there
and if not we can't, because it's cheaper
Uh-huh.
so mine is, monetarily, I guess strongly monetarily based.
Uh, we'll go get pizza and, uh, at Little Caesar's, although the kids prefer Domino's.
Oh, we are Little Caesar fans here
Right.
that's where we always go,
But it's just a lot cheaper than, than Domino's,
so that's.
We go to Grandy's quite a bit I would say.
Yes,
we like Grandy's, too.
McDonald's, uh, we've sort of been off of that for a while
and no particular reason,
and I,
maybe we avoided Wendy's the last few years because our daughter worked there
and she never wanted us to show up there
Oh.
so, I don't, we don't go there that much.
Where do you go if you like to have a nice meal out, or a big meal?
A nice meal, oh,
Where do you go for steaks?
It's usually when we're out of town
Oh.
and I'll order steak or steak and lobster combined
Uh-huh.
so it's really not in town.
Oh.
You ever been to Houston's on Belt Line?
No.
That's where we go to get steaks
Uh-huh.
they have a teriyaki steak there,
and when we have something to celebrate, we head to Houston's.
They don't take reservations,
and you wind up waiting about an hour
Uh-huh.
but the food is good,
and they've got a nice patio area that you can wait and get something to drink, unless you get there at five o'clock,
then you can go right through.
Right.
But they have real good signature salads there and nice steaks,
so, that's our nice place to go.
We don't usually take the kids when we go there,
But well, we don't go out that much,
I well, I guess we do go out without kids.
We're usually picking things up quickly,
though we just don't dwell on food too much,
Yeah.
and, uh, with my husband traveling he can get all he needs of that during the week going to those places
Right,
That's right.
so, it doesn't really matter to him.
He'd probably just like to stay home. Well, I think, I, I never have liked to cook food,
Yeah,
that's the way with my husband.
He's gone during the week and likes to eat at home on the weekends,
and I've been eating at home all week long with the kids and would like to go out somewhere,
so we have a conflict of interests on the weekend.
but I think it all began eating out when we had, uh, the boys in, in different, uh, baseball on baseball
Right.
it was mainly baseball teams
Yes.
and my husband would coach,
so we were never home at the same time.
Uh-huh.
I'm not one that's going to fix, you know, the meal at two o'clock in the afternoon so they can eat it all day whenever they're there.
Right.
or you go you know you fend for yourself.
Yep.
You go somewhere else.
