How would you go about organizing a family reunion?
Well,
for,
I grew up in the deep south like south Alabama.
So whenever I think of family reunions,
my family, like, got together almost every week.
Oh, gee.
And there would be like thirty people.
So people talk about, you know, big family reunions
and I think, like
I have a friend who just went to, like, Wyoming to some big ranch, you know, where like there were four hundred people for their family reunion.
Oh, my.
And I,

and I,
you know, when I go home I try to see the families, as much of the family as I can

Right.
I mean Sunday dinner was at my grandmother's
and, you know, like I said there would be thirty, you know, thirty people,
and everyone would just bring things
and my grandmother would cook and cook and cook.
Oh.
And
Well, I come from a very small family.
And we planned a family reunion this spring. Uh, where we are from Texas
and my family is from Ohio
and we met in Florida.
Uh-huh.
So the seven of us went on a cruise and then went to Disney together.
So that's all the family,
so planning our family reunion was very easy you know .
Yeah,
I guess so.
It really sounds like it was fun.
Yeah,
well, we had a wonderful
