Okay.
Okay
They suggested that we, uh, discuss what we think of when we say camping.
Yeah.
What do you, where do you like to camp?
How do you like to camp?
Oh, I can camp just about, most anyway
Camping or, uh, motor home is nice, uh, travel trailer, pop up,
I used to, uh, live in the Ozarks and, uh liked to go up there and just take a backpack and strike out into the woods.
Oh, really?
Oh.
You really rough it then.
Yeah.
Uh-huh.
Do you do that very often?
I haven't done it in quite awhile since I moved down here.
Uh-huh.
But I used to do it quite a bit.
Uh-huh.
You'd have a lot of hills in that, down in that area.
Yeah,
yeah
Yeah.
it was real hilly.
That would be really great.
Take a twenty-two
and go out.
Pardon?
Take a twenty-two
and find a creek.
Uh-huh.
That sounds like it'd be fun.
Did you go alone or with a group or,
I used to go with my brother.
Uh-huh.
We just lived up there.
Uh-huh.
Oh, that's great. Long as it's not raining.
Yeah,
it gets kind of,
I, we used to have one of those little caves you can go back in get out of the rain.
Uh-huh.
Really,
oh, that would be,
But I don't know much about camping in Texas.
Huh-uh.
Well, I'm in Pennsylvania.
You live in Pennsylvania?
Yes
I didn't know they did this.
Are you in Texas, now?
Yeah.
Oh.
Okay.
Yeah.
I'm down here at T I.
Most everybody I've been talking to is from Texas,
but, uh, we're up here in western, northwestern part of Pennsylvania.
I used to be in Ohio,
it's some pretty country up there.
Uh-huh.
Well you kind of know what it's like, then.
Yeah.
So,
But, we've, uh, we've done, uh, many types of camping.
We've, we've done tent camping,
and we had access to a motor home which is really super great, if you don't want to rough it too much.
Yeah.
You can get the, they have some nice camping grounds you know, that have the water piped out
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
just set it up
and get out of, get out of the city for awhile.
Right.
Just get you away from the everyday things that are going on.
We, when the children were smaller we used to go to, uh, Delaware along the ocean most every year.
And that was fun
we stayed mostly in state parks
and, uh, we really enjoyed that.
Tell you what,
I'm losing you.
Huh?
I said I'm losing you,
you're getting you're fading out.
Oh, maybe my, dropping my phone.
Is that better?
Yeah.
Oh.
But,
So what,
you try to go and take a vacation every year and go out and camp?
Yeah.
Well, we used to,
we don't as much anymore,
but, uh, we used to.
We kind of slowed down a little bit.
But, uh, I think the worst, the worst thing is when it's raining.
If you get a rainy season and you happen to be camping then it can be kind of bad.
Yeah.
I know the rain bring out the snakes or used to bring them out in the Ozarks,
Uh-huh.
That's kind of, kind of rough when you got to fight snakes off when your sleeping.
I don't think I would like that.
What kind?
Uh, copperheads mostly,
Oh.
Those aren't too pleasant.
No,
they're.
Yeah.
We have some of them around here.
You probably have more there, though, I would imagine.
Yeah.
One year they were, they were just everywhere.
Oh.
I don't know what it was,
we had a real rainy spring
Uh-huh.
and then it was all year,
there was just copperheads everywhere.
Uh-huh.
But you still backpacked and camped out.
Yeah.
Well I lived down in, down in the bottom of a big hollow
and we had to pretty much hike out most of the time.
Uh-huh.
If it rained we were stuck back in there.
Had a four wheel drive.
Uh-huh.
You just get used to it.
Yeah.
I guess you know enough to look where you're walking or sitting or whatever you're doing.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah,
I would think, I would think a cave would be, could have problems like that, too.
Yeah.
This cave that we used to go in was little,
it was small
it was more it was just big enough for a couple of people to sack out.
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh,
is your brother younger than you
or,
Yeah.
He's about a year and a half younger.
Uh-huh,
uh-huh,
well, that's great,
that'd be a lot of fun.
You have a lot good experiences from that.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah,
it was.
Saw a few bears things like that.
Did you really?
What, black ones?
Yeah.
Yeah.
That would be exciting.
Yeah,
the first, first couple of times it's pretty scary
but, uh, after that you realize they are just as afraid of you, too.
Yeah,
they're usually more afraid of you than you are of them, usually.
But, uh,
They're on the increase in this area.
Oh, really?
Uh-huh.
I don't know if,
they don't have them up there do they?
The black bear.
Yeah.
Oh, yeah.
Oh, do they?
Yeah,
the population's been really up.
They've, uh, they've had longer hunting seasons than that even to get rid of more of them, because they were, uh, increasing so much.
Yeah,
they, down here they, they stopped for awhile
or they really made it hard to hunt them.
Uh-huh.
I don't know what it's like now,
I haven't been back up there in awhile.
Yeah.
But, uh, we, we really like camping.
I, I must say that, uh, we we really have a lot of fun, a lot of memories in that from camping
and, uh.
Well, it's good to get out and smell some fresh air, too.
Yeah.
Yeah.
So,
It's just, so, it's a lot of work, too
Yeah.
it's, uh, you know, getting ready and taking care of everything.
But it's, um, it's really refreshing.
So,
Well, I think we're about to run out of our time.
I think so
Well, it was really good hearing from you
and I hope you get back into camping again, and do a little more of it.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I'm sure, I will.
Okay.
Thanks a lot,
and you have a good day.
You, too.
Bye-bye.
Bye.
