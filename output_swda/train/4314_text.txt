Well, we have,
we used to, when I was younger
Yeah.
we'd go every weekend.
All right .
But we haven't done whole lot of it lately.
Yeah.
I'm kind of into it.
I'm, uh, kind of a sailor.
Yeah.
I'm up in Minneapolis now,
but I was in Florida
so, uh, yeah,
I was kind of into it for a while there.
Were you sailboating?
Yeah,
for the most part.
Yeah
Yeah.
I had a little sail,
Well, we don't get to do a whole lot of that up here
No
Just motorboat's all we,
What part of Texas you from?
Uh, Nacogdoches.
Okay,
whereabouts is that?
That's between Houston and Dallas.
Okay,
all right.
It's the oldest town in Texas.
Is that right?
Yeah.
Wow,
that's pretty wild.
We have, uh, Lake Sam Rayburn out here and Lake Nacogdoches,
so we do a lot of boating on.
Okay,
so you got some lakes around you can do that on.
Yeah.
You do skiing and stuff
or,
Yeah,
little bit.
Yeah?
All right.
Just got through snow skiing
Yeah?
Yeah.
All right.
Just came back from Denver
but,
Yeah,
that sounds good.
Yeah,
we've, uh, our,
the snow up here is really kind of starting to melt now.
Yeah,
it, it, it was heavy when we were there though.
Yeah.
I didn't see any boats there, though.
Not, not, not too many, no.
But, uh, no,
I just got back from a weekend.
We went and, uh, had a, kind of a picnic in the woods type thing.
It was pretty nice,
but, uh, no, I, I have, uh, I had a boat last summer that I took out, a catamaran that I do, did a lot of sailing on and stuff.
Yeah?
That's a lot of fun,
but, uh, my parents are pretty big sailors, too,
they're kind of into it.
Uh, all we, all we have up here mostly bass boats.
Oh, yeah,
I guess it's pretty, uh, fishing's a pretty big thing, huh?
Uh-huh.
Yeah.
Lot of, lot of fishing going on up here.
Yeah.
All right.
So, where about in Texas is that?
Is that centrally located
or,
It's, uh, well,
you ever heard of Lufkin?
Uh, no,
what, what major city is nearby?
Houston.
Okay,
and that's south or north of there or something?
Let me see,
Houston's north.
Yeah?
Okay.
Dallas is south.
Oh, okay,
all right.
Well, that sounds pretty good.
Does, uh,
I guess the weather,
does that stay pretty constant there
or,
It's, it's gets cold at night, and then warm in the afternoons.
Yeah?
Probably seventies, eighties in the afternoon.
Okay,
well, that's pretty temperate.
Yeah,
that's not too bad.
But, uh, yeah,
have you done, uh, any other boating then
or,
No,
I hadn't done any in a uh, lately,
but that's all,
I used to uh, have a friend that owned, his daddy owned a boat shop.
Yeah?
And we used to, when I was in high school, we used to go out, go boating every day just about.
Oh, that's great.
Yeah,
I,
And we had a different boat every day.
Oh, that's fantastic.
Yeah,
I used to, uh, kind of be that way myself when I lived in, uh, north western Florida in the panhandle,
I used to sail about every day.
I'd work, go to work,
I'd like to do some sailing.
Yeah,
it's a lot of fun.
It's, uh,
especially if you get a, a pretty fast boat
like those catamarans are pretty fast.
Yeah,
what,
You can actually,
Do, if you get one like that do have somebody teach you that
or they just,
Well, actually, I, I've known how to sail pretty much my whole life.
Uh, my family's pretty into it
Yeah.
and, uh, I took sailing lessons when I was about six
and then, uh
Is it pretty easy?
Yeah,
it, it's kind of a thing where you get the hang of it after a while, you know, uh, just kind of get a feel for the wind and how it works and, and the physics behind it.
Yeah.
So it's, it's not too bad,
it's pretty easy to get the hang of, I think
and, uh, generally, everybody I've, I've known has kind of gotten into it,
but some people are more motorboaters, you know which is fine.
Yeah.
Well, that's about all we have
Yeah,
yeah,
lot of people don't, don't see the excitement in sailing,
but, then, again, they may they may never have tried anything like, uh, catamaran
Uh-huh.
and, uh, that's when you really start getting into speed. You know,
you actually, some catamarans you can actually pull people behind, the skiers,
they get so fast, you know.
I didn't know that.
Yeah,
they get pretty quick,
but
That that would be something.
uh,
Yeah,
yeah,
I haven't, I haven't personally done that,
but, uh, the races,
I, I work with a guy right now that, uh, races catamarans in the summertime
Uh-huh.
and, uh, he's pretty gassed about it.
He's got a good, uh,
What kind of, what lake do you all use?
Well, he, uh, he's from Detroit
Uh-huh.
so he usually goes on one of the Great Lakes, I think, and does his sailing. Uh,
for me, I, I go back to Orlando, uh, in about a month, and so, down there, basically just go to the coast.
We're about thirty miles from Coco Beach and the east coast,
and there's a lot of places there you can go, you know.
So, uh, so that's a good thing.
Yeah.
But, yeah, so, what do you do for a job?
Uh, I build transformers.
Oh, really?
Yeah.
Okay,
is that for T I
or,
No,
it's for Cooper Industries.
Okay.
Are they primarily electronic, then?
Yeah.
Okay.
Well
Well that,
they have a, you know, worldwide,
but
Right.
all we do here is make transformers electronics and stuff like that.
Oh, okay.
Great.
Yeah,
how do you like it down there in Texas?
It's real nice.
Yeah?
Been here all my life.
Oh, no doubt.
Yeah.
Okay.
I've never been to Texas.
I've been to Oklahoma,
but, uh, that's about as far as,
Oh, it's, Oklahoma's nothing like it.
Yeah?
Okay,
well, that's good, because I didn't like Oklahoma that well
