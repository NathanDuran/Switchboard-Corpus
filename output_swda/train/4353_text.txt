Okay.
Thanks.
Huh.
Do you all have a budget?
Well, uh, yeah,
we, we do.
Um, we've been married for twenty-three years
Uh-huh.
and we have, uh, three teenage daughters
and, you know, they're very expensive.
So, uh, uh, we, yeah, we have somewhat of, uh, a system.
Uh, it's, it's kind of, uh, you know, it's kind of hard to explain.
Yeah.
We've actually gone, uh, just recently, to you know having, having two checking accounts.
We always had just one.
Uh-huh.
And now we are having two.
Uh, it's kind of hard to talk about this because to me it's very personal.
Yeah.
It's,  uh,
So,  I have to be.
That's that's kind of the way I feel about it.
Yeah.
I usually, uh,
my wife handles a lot of the day to day finances
and of course, we're like like a lot of people.
We just scramble through month to month, you know.
Yes.
And, uh,
Do you have a two income family or one income?
Uh, we have a two income uh family.
Yeah.
She also works
Yeah.
and, uh, but she, she enjoys it
and she's good at it.
Uh, if it's, if it's,
I am kind of, uh, uh, I'm pretty bad about procrastinating
Uh-huh.
and one of these days I am going to do something about that
Yeah.
Yeah.
You know  how that goes,
but, uh, uh, if, she, she handles it pretty well.
She, uh she writes all the checks, you know, once a month.
So your wife,
Yes.
It
that
what
her, is her career, uh, related to, to finance or accounting?
Uh, sort of on a peripheral.
She's, uh, uh, an annuity administrator
Oh.
and so she, uh, she works for an insurance company.
Uh-huh.
But, but she enjoys it.
She likes keeping track of all that stuff
and, uh,
Yeah,
so that's sort of related to her field  a little bit.
Yeah
sort of.
Yeah.
And we, you know, we've experimented with, with, uh, budgets, you know from time to time, uh,
but, if, you know,
you have to keep up with them.
So a lot of times, we just, uh, just kind of play it by ear.
We try to keep our, uh, our retirement and our savings kind of automated
Yeah.
so we never see that money.
Just like taken  directly.
It's just  taking it out, right.
Right.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
We do the same thing.
And that, that's kind of handy.
Yeah,
because if you don't see it, you don't miss it
Yeah,
if
You don't spend it.
you have something to take it out.
That's exactly what we've always done
Yeah.
and we've had, uh, they've always had, uh, where they match your funds, you know,
sometimes if you, if you save so much, then they will match it.
Uh-huh.
Uh, that, you know, we've done that too.
But, my husband works for an insurance company
Uh-huh.
and he, he has now for about, oh gosh, how long has it been, ten years I guess.
But he was with another company before that,
but we have, we have,
I, I work also,
but I only have a part time job
Uh-huh.
and I get paid very little
but, uh, you know, I try to use that money for food
Jim gives me a certain amount money.
You know, we just transfer it into my account
Yeah.
Uh-huh.
and then I use that for food, household expenses,
and then I add my own check to that
and then with that I try and handle, you know, some of the clothes that the girls need and things like that,
Yeah.
but the expenses that we need and have around the house.
Yeah.
It  sounds like you all pretty much do it the same we do.
So.
Just kind of play it by ear, but keep the, the  deductions  you know
Yeah.
Yeah,
we
well Jim  has, Jim has a budget.
I mean he works it out every month and breaks it all down.
Uh-huh.
Uh, you know. I am given so much money a month,
so I am suppose to kind of get the food out of that.
Uh-huh.
So, I try not to, you know,
we don't, you know, I don't ask for more.
I mean I just try and make it on that.
Uh-huh.
Yeah
Because I think when you go to the grocery store, you can just, you can go crazy with all the choices that you have
Yeah.
Uh-huh.
and, uh, you can, you can really waste a lot of money that way.
Yeah.
So, uh, well how long have you been married?
Uh, about five years.
Yeah.
Oh, yeah.
So you're just really getting started
So do you have a family too?
Uh, I've got one little girl.
She's like, uh, nineteen months.
Oh yeah.
Yeah.
So, uh, she's, she's not, uh,
She hasn't effected your budget yet really.
Not, not really.
Not too  bad. Uh.
No.
Not like she will later on.
Yeah.
You will see  that  all of a sudden you're paying, you're trying to decide whether you are going to do, you know, soccer and piano and all these choices that they have of activities to do
Yeah
when,
Uh-huh.
and then you really have to start saying okay, now what can we afford you know,
Yeah.
what can we do here
and then you have to really sit down and plan some more
and, uh, but I think when we were back at your age, we didn't have much of a budget
Yeah.
and then as the girls got older, I think we, we did more and more of that.
You know, more budgeting as as they got older.
Uh-huh.
Uh, but uh, but what do you do?
Do you,
I'm uh, I, I work for, I'm an electronic technician.
Oh, okay.
I work at a, for a university. Uh, Georgia Tech, uh, research
Oh.
Well good.
and, uh,
Good.
So I just, uh,
Well, we just have,  you know, we have a good friend that's about to move to Atlanta.
I guess we're not suppose to talk about those things.
I'd better get back to the subject.
Oh, well
But, uh, budgeting.
I found, you know, I feel a lot better.
You know, we use to work out of one check book
Uh-huh.
and it would be very hard for me because I wouldn't have, I wouldn't have any idea how much money I was spending  in one month.
Yeah.
Now, I have, know exactly what I'm spending
and it's so much easier,
