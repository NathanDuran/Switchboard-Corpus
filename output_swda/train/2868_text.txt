Okay, uh,
have you, did you, have you grown up in Dallas, Stephanie?
Uh, no
I've only been here for the last ten years, uh,
Oh, where are you from?
I grew up most of my childhood in Germany.
In Germany.
Uh, and,
Well,
we,  we took a lot of vacations while we were there because everything was within driving distance.
Now there's a place I'd like to visit
So we, we travelled all over Europe. When I was, when I was very young. Unfortunately, a, a little bit too young to really appreciate.
Oh, that's neat.
Uh-huh.
Uh, I was grade school age. Uh,
My my husband had a bicycle tour of Europe, or took a bicycle tour about five months right after the second world war
and so we've seen lots of pictures of the, of the beautiful,  spots  and,  areas,
Um.
That,  that would be a, to me, a really nice vacation because I'm, I'm not in physical shape for something like that, but, uh, I, I sure would work on it  if  I had an opportunity like that.
Yeah,
that's neat, neat
What kind of vacations do you like?
Uh, well my husband and I are scuba divers.
Oh.
So, we both like to go to dive resorts.
Uh, we went to Hawaii on our honeymoon,
Uh-huh.
and  we dove there.
Uh, but, we, we did about six dives while we were there.
And, uh, we were originally planning on going to Cayman,  uh, last  year
Oh, uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
uh, but, we weren't able to get enough people together for the trip.
We had to have, like, eleven people for,  this package,  uh, deal.
Oh, uh-huh.
Yeah.
Uh, and we couldn't get enough people together, uh, to go,
so it ended up falling falling through.
Yeah.
We were going to get a really good price.
When, when our children were younger, we enjoyed, we lived up in, uh, New York,  or  New Jersey and, and used to like, uh, traveling into upstate New York and camping
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
and we had a little collapsible sailboat and liked to sail and, that sort of thing,
but we've never really, uh, did any diving or anything.
Little bit of of, uh, uh, oh,   water skiing.
Snorkeling?
Oh, really.
But, not much of, uh,  of  anything else.
Um.
Uh,
Well, my husband and I both like water,
Uh-huh.
so  any, any vacation that we go on is usually,  involves, close to the ocean,   or,  or something like that.
It's got to be the water.
Right.
When, when we were in Jersey, we used to go down to the Jersey beach a lot, and really enjoyed that a lot.
It's really, they had,  a really  nice beach areas there.
Yeah,
we,  After we moved away from Germany, we moved to New Hampshire.
Uh-huh.
And I lived there for seven years.
Oh, I see.
Uh,  and I really enjoyed that because,  you know, the mountains were real close,
That's a really pretty area, too.
Uh-huh.
we  like the, we like the white mountains
and, Uh, unfortunately, I didn't really get to go skiing much while I was there.
Yeah.
I went skiing once.
Yeah,
we loved the, we loved the, the New Jersey area, too, because the the lakes were really pretty close, you know,
you could,  you  could drive within twenty minutes to an hour and just be at a real nice vacation spot where you could sail and, and just really,
Uh-huh.
and then we weren't too for from the Appalachian Trail,
we did quite a bit of hiking,
which is kind of fun.
Are you a, you a hiker, or not?
Uh,
Not so much, huh?
Not, not really so much.
If, if, if there was some place that, that we went to where there was hiking involved, I, I would be you know, happy to go hiking,
Uh-huh.
but  we, we never have really planned a vacation around, uh, places to go hiking.
So your, your next, your plans are try to find someplace to scuba dive.
Yeah.
Our next vacation will, will be scuba diving,
I'm sure.
You have any children?
No,
not yet.
Okay,
then that's probably one of the reasons our,
we had little children all the time,
Yeah.
so  some of the things are not as, quite as, uh,  adaptable.
Yeah,
it's a, it's a little more, difficult planning a vacation,  when you have,  have children.
Yeah,
it is.
You have to try to figure out kinds of things that you can do that they will enjoy, too,
and,
Yeah.
so,  I think,
Yeah,
and diving is something that,
especially for small children, uh,
I think the, the minimum age for diving is,  is  probably, legal anyway,  would be probably about sixteen.
Yeah.
Eleven or twelve, I would  think, probably
but, maybe fifteen even.
Yeah.
I know that, uh, uh, one of, one thing that happens to us to vacation trips now is that usually that try to involve some of the members of the family.
You know, we go wherever somebody is,  that  we haven't seen for a while
Uh-huh.
So that, that's kind of,
uh, we just came back from, uh, uh, Grand Rapids where we saw one of our sons graduate,  from,  uh, with his Master's Degree in social work
and so that was fun,
and, and the summer we have a, we have a, a reunion in, in Salt Lake area up by Park Cities. Where we're going to camp for a week with as many members of, of a rather large reunion group that, uh, as we can get together
so,
That, that sounds like a lot of fun.
Our family had a reunion last year that was kind of like that, too,
Yeah.
that  there were several hundred, uh, people
and they all kind of met at a central place.
I, I didn't go,
Um.
uh,  but it would have been nice. It would have been a nice vacation.
We, we've we've moved around enough so that we now have people in different parts of the country.
I guess my favorite vacation idea would be to somehow figure out something kind of mobile where you could stop and sleep maybe, you know, like a,  a  small camper.
Uh-huh.
We've, we've travelled in a big one.
I hate them because they're hard to jockey around, you know,
but maybe a pickup with the back on,
or something like, uh, what's the, like the Volkswagen Vanagon. I've heard is really nice.
Yeah.
So you could kind of sleep in it sometimes,
but you wouldn't want to do it all the time.
Yeah.
Uh, we have enough friends here and there,
I would just love to just drive through the United States and stop and see people I know, and visit for a day and then go on and, you know.
Uh-huh.
My dad has been talking for years about, uh, getting a fifth wheel and just picking up,
Uh-huh.
he's retired
Uh-huh.
uh, he's in his sixties,
and he, uh, would like to just get a fifth wheel and just travel across the country and spend a month here or a couple of weeks there,  and  just, you know, not,  be  settled anywhere,
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah,
I think,  I think that would real,
just see, see  the rest of the country.
and I would like to maybe not take great long trips, but, but have your home base, where your home is and then just travel out for, like, maybe, oh, a month, maybe go,
Uh-huh.
He, he does that quite a bit.
And,
He, he hasn't lately, though, uh, because he's been ill,
Yeah.
uh,  but he's been known to be gone for a month or two at a time
and, you know, he'll say, this is my itinerary.
I'm going here, here and here
and I'll be back in about two months
Yeah.
There are a lot of neat, neat places to visit in America,
that's for sure.
We've, I haven't been much to the south,
I haven't been in, in Georgia or Florida or Mississippi or Alabama.
I guess that's, those are the only states I have not visited.
But, uh, up the coast, uh, at, uh, uh, in Maryland and around there, where the, where the early history is, there's some
Johnstown and, uh, in in that area is just really neat,
interesting things to
so, you know.
Uh-huh.
so,
Have you been a, to a lot of the different historical sites?
Yeah,
we took a trip, uh, around to the, uh, Civil War battle grounds and things back in nineteen sixty when it was the centennial or something,
Uh-huh.
I  believe it was.
Uh, had about three kids then I think,
but that was a really fun, interesting trip.
I we, we read Bruce book before we went, you know,
and, so we were ready to look up the places we read about.
Yeah,
I I think right, right now while my husband and I don't have any kids we'll probably take as many vacations as we can doing things like scuba diving and,  and  adventurous types of things,
Yeah.
and  then when eventually, when we have kids,
Yeah.
Now, his, his folks did a lot of traveling across country.
You know they went to the Grand Canyon and did things like that.
Well, now, camping is fun with kids.
If you're,  you  know,
Yeah.
once they get a little bigger, not teeny tiny ones,
but, even, even some little ones do pretty good
but,  but  when they get a little bigger so they can help,
Yeah.
that, that's a fun way to to, uh, cut costs
and it's enjoyable, too.
Very restful.
I mean I find,
Yeah,
I, I do enjoy camping.
Yeah,
I find the outdoors very relaxing and, you know, kind of a change.
As long as I have a shower nearby, I'm fine And electricity.
Yeah
Well, I'm with you.
I need my creature comforts, too.
Yeah.
Well, it was great to talk to you.
It was nice talking to you, too, Beth.
Okay,
see you later.
Bye-bye.
Okay.
Bye-bye.
