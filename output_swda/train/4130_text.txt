So, Julie, how do you feel about AIDS research?
I think we need, we definitely need more of it, definitely.
I'd agree, too,
but, I mean, it seems like it just makes economic sense in that, you know, uh, you know,
it would have made even better economic sense to, to, to have had a lot more research than a longer ago.
Oh, yeah,
yeah,
for certain.
You know, because, you know, because, uh, the country's going to wind up paying for the treatment of patients.
Exactly.
Uh-huh.
Exactly.
Does, does like, do health insurance policies, like, for companies and things, do they cover diseases like that?
I think they cover AIDS,
but what they do is, uh, if, you know, you apply for, for to get a, a insurance policy they'll, uh, check to see if you're H I V positive
Uh-huh.
and if you are, not only will they not give you, uh, a policy,
but they'll, uh, they have like,
there's like, you know, a database of people that have tested positive,
so you'll never be able to get insurance ever again.
Um, well, that's, but that's why they should have started doing stuff before.
I mean, still, you know, since it's dormant for such a long time, there's still probably a lot of people, you know, before the tests ever really came out who are, who are draining a lot of money right now. You know,
Yeah.
I think a lot of it was, was just that, you know, because of, of the, you know, because, because the majority of the high risk groups were people no one really cared about.
Right.
Right.
That,
Right,
and all these God-fearing people were like, well, you know God is trying to kill off all the et cetera, et cetera .
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh,
yeah,
uh, yeah,
one, one, one one humorous retort I heard, heard someone, you know, who claimed that, you know, AIDS was, you know, God's punishment was that, then lesbians must be God's chosen people.
Uh.
Yeah.
But, uh,
Boy,
that's a good one.
So, uh,
Yes?
Uh, do you think, you mean, do you actually think we're doing enough right now to,
No,
I really don't.
I did, I did like a research kind of thing on AIDS research and stuff,
and, uh, really we're not doing much at all,
I mean, most of what gets raised, I mean, it's not really federal movement, most of what gets raised, gets raised by, uh, uh, you know, conscious, yeah, communities and things like that, you know.
Private organizations.
Uh-huh.
Like, uh, San Francisco has a, a real, uh, strong AIDS support group and all that kind of stuff
and and, uh, get, they get donations from the community, you know, they're real, And from corporations around the, around the city, you know, for AIDS research and that kind of thing
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
and, uh, I think there needs to be more of that sort of on a federal level, you know, rather than just in the places where it's, you know, where it's predominated so far, because it's, you know it's bound to spread
Uh-huh.
I mean, it seems that, you know, it's just, you know, of, it's just going to reach a steady, a steady state a let, a lot, lot higher point than it will if we, you know, we'd nip it in the bud to quote Barney Fife.
Right
Yeah.
I don't know,
I don't know,
I, I, I don't know what the likelihood of that is,
but, I mean, you know, people really waking up.
Uh-huh.
Especially with the ultra conservatives move our, our political system sort of seems to be taking.
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
I would probably agree with that.
Yeah
so,
Uh, so do, do you think it's more important to spend money on research or for support of, uh, people?
God,
that's a good question, Fish.
I don't know,
uh, I think, I think one of the main things that's really important to spend money on is education, not support or, or, research per se, but, but education because a lot of people sort of get drummed out of the work place and out of society, you know, kind of like lepers would you know
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
and it's really, it's really not necessary, uh, until, until the, disease reaches its final stage, you know, becomes really infectious
Uh-huh.
and, uh, I think that would be the most effective support they could get is for other people to understand, you know, try to understand what they're going through and everything and try to understand that they're not, you know, they don't, they don't have to be just completely cut off from, from the community
Uh-huh
Uh-huh.
and that, and, uh, I don't know,
I guess I think that, that, uh, research is, I guess the most important, just because I, you know, it, it really needs to come to an end. You know.
Uh-huh.
I don't know.
I don't know, Fish.
What do you think about that subject?
I think it's, I think it stands a really interesting question of, uh,
