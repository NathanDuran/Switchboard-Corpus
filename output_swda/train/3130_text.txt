Hi,
good morning.
Good morning.
Do you have  recycling in Sachse?
Yes,
we do.
We've  got, uh, a pickup twice a week that they come out
Do,
and, they have their own special bin that they hand it out to everybody
and they take it.
Oh really?
Uh-huh.
And it's  twice a week?
Uh-huh.
Really?
We have, recently started, uh, a bin program here in Plano where, uh,
used to be we, we put all of our trash in green bags and the trash men came out twice a week and picked up.
And now they have, uh, these large green containers
and you have to put your trash that you don't recycle in there.
And then they haven't started curbside recycling yet,
but they're, but they're planning on doing it very soon.
Apparently the trucks that they had, um, lined up, they needed the parts for, Saudi Arabia
Oh.
And so that put off the program for a while.
But, uh, do you recycle?
Um, my kids do
Do they?
Uh-huh.
Put it  that way.
They, they've been recycling cans for extra money.
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
So that's, that's been their summer money
and they're fixing to go to Disneyland.
So,
Oh, well
So,
that's  great.
Yeah.
Well  that's the way we started too.
My daughter was going, to Camp Goddard, um, which is through the Plano school system,  you know in the fall  couple of years ago
Uh-huh.
and she had to earn money for it
and she was too young to baby-sit.
So, that's how she started.
She started recycling cans
and from there we now recycle glass and newspapers and, uh, aluminum cans and plastics.
Really?
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh
Is, is that the same way as with the aluminum cans where you go
and they, weigh it or whatever
and,
No,
the only thing we get paid for are the aluminum cans.
Um.
Um, the rest of it we just do because my husband has become hooked on recycling.
And so, you know, we don't get paid for that
but that's okay.
Yeah.
You know,  it's, it's not that much of a bother really.
You just have to rinse out your bottles or whatever
and we use a lot of, two liter bottles. Um, and like milk cartons and things like that.
It's amazing how much plastic you generate.
Yeah,
I was amazed at how many cans  that  we got
Yeah.
Yeah.
because when the kids first went down, I said, that, you know that's great
and I was thinking, you know maybe I'd help supplement it, you know when they turned them in
Uh-huh.
but it's amazing how many cans you go through.  And how fast they accumulate.
Yeah
it really is.
Well all that stuff
and how much,  how much we have reduced our waste.  You know,  that we, we're generating a week.
Uh-huh.
Um, I know our neighbors, when we first went to this bin program said, oh, there's no way, you know we're going to have to have pickup twice a week.
They were real upset
but they weren't, they were only picking up once a week.
And we said to them, if you recycle, you'll, you know, you'll go two weeks without having to put out the green container.
Yeah.
And, uh, it's, it's really amazing.
The other thing he does, that my husband a real stickler about is we don't collect our grass clippings.
Really.
No.
He, he got a little mulcher thing.
Uh-huh.
It's just a little  attachment for the lawn mower
and we mow once a week.
You know, no, no more often then that.
And then the clippings just get mulched up and then just lay on the, on, on, the, uh, the lawn.
And it's amazing,
it's amazing.
We don't collect any of that
and that, that has cut down a lot in what we throw out.
Yeah,
we don't we don't catch it either, mainly because my husband rarely has time to mow the yard.
So, if it mows, gets mowed, I do it normally.
Uh-huh.
And I can't mow the yard with the grass catch on it.
It's too heavy.
Yeah.
So I just  I just mow it and leave it.
Yeah.
It just  soaks in.
Sure it does.
Sure it does.
It really does
and it,
actually they say that you're wasting fertilizer if you're not, uh, if you're catching your grass clippings.
Uh-huh.
That, that's that much fertilizer you have to use because it does fertilize the lawn.
It's amazing.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Oh, I like it better doing it.
Well one,
it cuts down on my mow time anyway
Uh-huh,
that's true.
and you zip through  it quicker.
That's true.
That's true.
Well, I, I really think you're going to get hooked on plastics and paper before you know it.
we probably will.
It's, it's really not that much trouble.
We keep a large plastic, uh, just a, you know, a garbage bag in the garage.
Yeah.
And as soon as we use something, you know, we crush it up and put it out there
and then, you know, every few weeks we have recycling, a recycling center like near Wal-Mart.
Uh-huh.
They're, they have the containers that you can just go over there and drop it in
and it's really no trouble.
And, uh, I feel like at least we're doing something.
Yeah.
You know, , um, I read a book one time or a a magazine article
and they said something about how you don't realize even just your small contribution, it seems like a small contribution
but it's not.
If everyone were to recycle just their newspapers, they would save thousands and thousands of trees a day. A day, just from not throwing out your newspapers.
Really.
And, uh, when you read that you think, well gee, maybe it is a big deal, you know.
What, what makes me sick is, is when they show the dump sites  you know,  and, and, how big they are.
Uh-huh
Uh-huh.
Or  like in New York, the barges that that go up and down the, the river
Yes.
Yeah.
and they  don't have any place to put it
and it just floats in the ,
it's like ugh.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
And that's, and that's really not necessary.
No.
It  really isn't
if everybody would do just a little bit it would make a big difference.
It would make a huge impact.
So, I'm excited about the recycling program in Plano
I, I, can't wait for them to get it started. Um, because it'll be that much easier for us,
you know, like I said, now we have to take it over to, to Wal-Mart.
It would be real nice if they just came by and just picked up.
Yeah.
It, it's  it's convenient out here  for them to do it.
Um
Now what, what  do they pick up?
It's just,
They pick up the, the plastic, the glass, and the newspaper.
Oh they do?
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
And do you  have to sort that?
And they will do the
Or do you just put it all in.
No,
you just put it in the one bin
and, and I guess they do the sorting.
But, um, they'll do the aluminum cans too
but we don't give them those
Right.
Right.
The kids  keep those
So,
So you're doing that now?
You're doing the newspapers and the glass?
Uh-huh.
Well  we don't, we don't take the newspaper to begin with. When, neither one of us are home   to read it.
Oh, uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
So we don't have the newspapers but the, the plastic and the glass
At first, when it first started, it, it, it was hard. You know, because you're just used to throwing things.
Uh-huh.
My husband would, come home and go through the trash and say, you threw this away
Uh!
He would get, he would get all upset
and I'd say,
it's just such an automatic reaction.
And now  we think  before we throw anything away.
It is.
I mean, it's really funny.
We, we really,
once you get into the habit of it, it's okay,
it's just, it's just making it a habit that's hard
Oh, I know.
Well the kids have even got to the point where they, if they see anybody going in the trash can with a can, you know, they, they're, oh, no, don't do that
and they go to the sink, they rinse them out, and they put them upside down, they let them drain
and and then, uh, after a couple of days they take them all outside
Uh-huh.
and, I put them in a big bag anyway
Uh-huh.
and then they dump the bag out
and then they crush them.
So that's  their activity thing. To  go out there and crush.
Uh-huh.
That's fun.
Yeah,
yeah,
So,
yeah.
Oh, that's a lot of fun.
Yeah.
That's a lot of fun.
Well, that's great.
Well I'm to hear you're, doing that.
I,
my sister was here recently from Connecticut
and they have a deposit on all their bottles and cans.
Oh really?
