Okay,
you want to go ahead and tell me your favorite team, or who you think will be doing well this year.
Uh, well, where I'm from the Atlantic coast conference is a very big conference
and, course, we have Duke University that was the national champions last year,
so I'm kind of hoping that they'll repeat again this year.
They have a lot of the same players back.
Are we talking about, is this the N B A?
No,
this is college basketball.
This is college, College, okay
Right.
We have like Carolina, and Duke, and Georgia Tech, and N C State, teams that are normally ranked in the top twenty.
Uh-huh.
So, hopefully we'll have a good year.
I don't really follow the N B A very closely.
And see that's probably all, all I saw.
I, we have moved in the last couple years from Utah to Texas
and there's so many colleges and universities in Texas, we haven't really followed them too much
and none of them are our, our alma mater
so, that seems to help.
Do you like professional basketball?
Uh, I, I follow it especially around the playoffs,
so, course, I was real familiar with the Utah Jazz,
and the Mailman or Karl Malone was, you know, pretty big thing
and, the Lakers have always been amazing to watch.
Yeah.
I, I did keep track a little bit of the Mavericks.
They've not had any good seasons for a long time, and have a lot of problems with, with Tarpley
and, maybe now that that's over they'll, they'll come out of it
but,
Well, that's an up and coming team, though.
Yeah,
I hope they do something.
They need to
or they're not going to have any of the team left at all.
That's somebody you can get behind and, be patient.
Yeah.
Kind of like the Cowboys I guess.
Yeah,
they seem to be kind of not having a very good few seasons.
Yeah,
they, coming out of it this year.
We'll see if it's held on.
But, I think Chicago will probably with the N B A again.
The Bulls?
Yeah,
uh-huh.
Yeah.
They'll probably be pretty good.
Course, the Celtics are always really, really good, too, with their players.
That's true.
Be interesting to see how the Olympics does this year with all the, the N B A players playing on the Olympic team.
That's true,
it will be interesting.
So,
It will certainly be different
Yeah.
I don't know, how close I'll follow them, though.
And the season hasn't started yet.
I'm usually more the end of the season person,
and we need to talk about baseball
and so,
Yeah,
oh, my Atlanta Braves.
Well,
Well, I really do, uh, you know,
the basketball season's supposed to start in the next couple of weeks.
It's,
yeah,
yeah.
It's a long season.
It is, it is,
and that's why I've,
I guess my mind went blank.
It's like last season was so long ago
and I haven't really even started thinking about basketball yet
so,
Yeah.
But, this wasn't a good subject,
but, We'll see how our predictions come true.
It's a little early.
We definitely will.
Okay,
it's good talking to you.
Good to talk to you.
All righty,
bye.
Bye-bye.
