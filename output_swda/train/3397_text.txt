Okay.
Well, it's not often you get, uh, many women interested in football
Oh well
Do you follow football very much?
I'm sorry, what?
Do you follow football very much?
I don't,
no,
I haven't recently, um.
Well we can talk about something else.
Do you have any, uh,
you married?
No,
I'm not,
no.
No,
well, I guess kids are out.
What's that?
Kids are out.
Yep
Are you married?
Yeah,
I, I'm married.
Got two boys.
Oh, really.
Yeah.
Wow.
So do you like football?
Oh, I follow the, uh, the Cowboys
but that's about it, uh.
The, the same here
Yeah.
Do you live in Dallas?
Yeah,
I, I, I am a pretty big Dallas fan, been for a long time
Yeah.
but I haven't been to any games recently.
But, uh, I try to catch the game every weekend that I can.
Really?
Yeah.
Have you ever been to a Cowboy's game?
I haven't,
huh-uh.
Um, it's pretty nice.
We we decided just to watch them at home
But.
That's good.
At least you, uh, follow the game a little bit.
Yeah.
Um, yeah,
I'm not a fanatic about it.
I don't know who played when and who does what like some guys are.
I just like to watch,
and, and hopefully they win
Uh-huh.
That's about the extent of it.
Yeah.
Right now I'm in, um, college,
so I'm more into college football than professional, I think.
Oh, I see.
What, uh, school are you going to?
Um, I'm at B Y U.
B Y U,
okay.
Yeah,
so.
Leslie, what are you studying?
Nursing.
Nursing.
Great.
Yeah.
My mom's an L V N.
Oh, really.
Yeah.
So, what are you planning to go into?
Do you want to be an R N
or,
Yeah,
yeah.
Um, I haven't really picked a field.
I haven't, I, I don't know, I've thought a lot about labor and delivery
but I don't know.
Uh-huh.
Try that.
That's what my mom does, labor and delivery.
Oh, really.
Wow.
Yeah,
she loves it.
She, she really, uh, enjoys.
Is she a nurse in Dallas?
No,
she's a nurse in San Antonio
Oh.
but, uh, she's been, she's been working a, uh, on a late shift.
She works the, uh, I guess the graveyard's what you'd call it.
Uh-huh.
She works the graveyard shift.
And she's worked that for, oh, years, when I was small.
Um.
Uh, I guess probably going on twenty years now.
Wow.
And she really enjoys it.
She likes the quiet that you have at that time of the night
and, uh, and, uh, she's, uh, she just started a new job at a different hospital, closer to where she lives
Uh-huh.
and she's really enjoying herself.
She really likes it.
Well, that's great.
Well, good luck to you in pursuing your nursing degree.
Oh thanks
Hope you'll like it.
Yeah.
Do you plan on staying in, in the Dallas area?
Um, I'd like to come back to Dallas.
Right now I'm in Utah, of course.
Oh, uh-huh
So, um,
but, my family's there,
so,
yeah,
I'd like to go back.
Yeah,
uh, I think Texas, San Antonio in particular, has got a large, uh, base of hospitals.
Uh, I don't know about Dallas.
I think Dallas is pretty scattered.
Are you in San Antonio?
No,
I'm, I'm in Dallas
Oh, okay.
but I'm originally from San Antonio
Um.
and they've got large medical, uh, center down there.
They've got the U T Health Science Center out there also.
Right.
So if ever wanted, you know, pursue anything more than your nursing degree, that, that'd be the place to do it.
Yeah,
my brother-in-law, um, is in the medical profession, I mean, he's at medical school in San Antonio right now.
Oh, great.
So.
Great.
Yeah.
Well, like I said, good luck to you.
Thanks.
All right,
well, um, take care,
and maybe we'll meet up again some time.
All right.
Okay.
Bye-bye.
