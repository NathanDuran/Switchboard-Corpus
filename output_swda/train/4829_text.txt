Okay Uh, let me see.
Unfortunately, we are not much into recycling.
Uh-huh.
We don't, we don't do enough.
I know we don't so
Uh, although lately I've been, uh,
a friend of mine that I spend a lot of time with does recycle quite a bit
and it's, it's, it's, uh, interesting to watch some of the things that she does
and then she's almost had an impact on me, uh, where she doesn't say anything to me when she comes to my house but I can kind of tell it bothers her so, just unconsciously I've, I've stopped buying a lot of, uh, uh, paper plates and paper cups
and I don't do that anymore.
I don't know why,
I just don't I just, just from socializing with her
so.
How do you, how, uh, is recycling done in your community?
Is,
It really, it, there's not a whole lot,
there really isn't.
Uh, I know in my mother's neighborhood in San Antonio, each, each house has,
they're, they're given three baskets
Uh-huh.
and they put them out on a certain day of the week
Right.
and each, uh, home does participate
but we really don't have anything, uh, close in this area that, that do anything.
And, and some of the communities that do, the residents are having to pay to participate in it. Which really doesn't make sense.
Oh.
Right.
Over here, they, uh, have several private companies that you can take, uh, recycled, materials to.
But, uh, if you want to take them all to one place, they have, uh, the first Saturday of every month, they have certain places that you can drop them off.
That's what I do.
Uh, and I, I recycle aluminum, glass, uh, newspapers.
Yeah,
that's good.
So it's nice to have, you know, one place that you can take them all to instead of driving  the glass to one place
Yeah,
yeah.
That's another thing.
You have to go to different places to do that.
Right.
So it's, so that's nice.
It would be, it would be really nice if they, uh, came to the house to pick it up
and they just were talking about a bill in Tucson about that,
but, uh, uh, it didn't go through.
Uh-huh.
But I heard that most homes that do participate in that are having to pay a monthly fee to do that. Which, uh,
I don't know,
it just doesn't make sense to me.
Right.
I guess what they, what they were talking about here was, uh, was reducing the garbage collection in order to make that up or something, you know.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Uh, so I guess that's one option.
Yeah.
That's good,
that's good.
I guess  one thing they're working on now is recycling plastics too.
Like, uh
Uh-huh.
have you noticed that on the bottom of plastic goods, they have this little number now that tells  what  kind of plastic it is?
Huh.
No.
Yeah,
I guess the problem with plastic is there's so many different kinds that you can't recycle,
you can't just throw all plastic into one recycler.
Oh, I didn't know that.
Yeah.
So now they're like marking, uh,
they're,
I don't know,
there's six, seven, eight different kind of plastics
and they, they mark on the bottom what kind it is.
Yeah.
So I guess that makes it easy to recycle
and then they're, they're, uh, trying to make plastic goods that don't have a bunch of different plastics in them, you know, that are, that are only made out of one kind of plastic
so that that makes it easier I guess.
Uh-huh.
Well, that's good.
I, I'm, you know,
unfortunately Garland doesn't have, doesn't,
they don't, I don't know, they don't do anything like that
or I, you know, I read those little slips that come in to your, utility bills or your, uh, garbage collection
Right.
and they haven't, you know, talked about doing something like that
Where does your friend go to to recycle?
She lives in Garland
and I'm not sure where, what she does.
But she's, uh, oh she's very heavy in that
and she takes her own bags to the grocery store
Uh-huh.
Uh, she has, I, I really don't think she has any paper products in her house.
Yeah.
Uh, and just a lot of things I've learned off of her that, to start doing.
And she does make a lot of sense.
Yeah.
Just her whole house is like wow.
I guess that's how it gets passed on. You know, when one person,  you hear  from another person
Yeah.
and then, uh, and then you, and then you pass it on.
Yeah.
It seems to be catching on, uh, slowly but surely, I guess
Yeah.
And, uh, my little boy has, watches a program that was really neat.
I sat and watched him.
You know the Barney?
You know the little, I don't know if you know the little character Barney.
Uh-huh.
They had one, uh, on that kind of, type of thing
and how children can, can do that
and how to save water when you brush your teeth in water
and it's really caught on
and he's only four
and he's really caught on.
Uh-huh.
Wow,
that's cute.
That's neat,
yeah.
When you,
And keep  the refrigerator door closed and that kind of thing.
He's really caught on
so that's really neat
Well, when you start early, I guess,
