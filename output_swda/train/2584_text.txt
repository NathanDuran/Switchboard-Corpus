Okay.
Do you go camping very much?
No,
I've haven't gone camping in years.
But it's is something that I've done in the past.
How about you?
Uh, we try to go once, maybe twice a summer. Uh,  we, uh, just, you know, for  like a short weekend or something.
That's, that's pretty average to me
We don't go for the long, you know, week long thing.
Uh-huh.
But we usually go to, uh, a lake area, you know, where the campsites,  are  and do that. Uh,
Right.
Do you tent camp
or do you have a camper?
Oh no,
no,
no
a tent.
That's what I you know,
that's how I camp too.
That's how I define camping
Me too
You're really roughing it.
The rest, the rest of that is really not the same.
Yeah.
As a matter of fact, my, my, you know, the majority of the amount of camping I've done has been really roughing it.
Um, as a little girl I'd go with my dad and my uncle and my brother,
and we went to the Boundary Waters area in Minnesota.
So,  that's,  that's really wild.
Oh.
Yeah.
Are you here in local Texas,
I mean?
Yes,
I'm in Austin,
where are you?
I'm in Garland.
Oh.
Right outside of Dallas.
Uh-huh.
So we, um, we have a five year old,
and we started taking her, she was pretty young when we started, uh, camping with her.
Oh, the kids love it.
I know.
I mean, they just love it.
It's wonderful for them to be outside.
I know,
and then they, and they, you know,
there's no T V,
and they don't have all these modern toys,
and they have to use sticks and rocks and stuff like,  that  to play with.
Exactly.
Yes.
And I like that.
It's pretty fun.
Well, how it,
it's really is a, is a good, good family thing,  to  do.
Uh-huh.
Yeah.
Yeah.
And,
We, we try to, uh, go with another couple that have children also.
Uh-huh.
And, uh, that makes it a lot more enjoyable.
Plus, you know, we don't have to go out and buy all the equipment and stuff, you know,
we kind of split it up. Uh,
Good planning
Yeah
Because it gets, it really does get expensive if you, if you don't want to rough it all the way.
Exactly.
You know, even the sleeping bags, those are running, you know, a good thirty dollars a pop,
and,  and so  we've built that up.
You're right.
But,
Do you have a boat?
No.
No?
Want one bad.
Do you?
Oh, well, actually, I would, you know what I would love?
I would absolutely love a sail boat.
Oh.
That doesn't go along with camping,
but,  now that,  that, that's what I would like,  to  have.
Yes
Yeah,
I would too.
Yeah.
Would too.
We usually,
uh, let's see,
we try to go to a lake.
My husband and this, uh, other couple that we go with, her husband, um, kind of likes, um, is it scuba dive?
And, so we'll go to a lake and, uh, where they can go do that.
Uh-huh.
We're  close enough so they can do that,
and the girls can play on the beach area
And I would play on the beach area too.
Yeah.
That's what I would do.
Yeah
Yeah.
That's fun.
I'm just sitting here listening to your accent and thinking what a good time the computer is going to have with that.
Really?
Am I pretty Texan?
You're pretty Texan.
Yes.
But you know, you know what's really funny?
Um, I've had people tell me that I have a Texas accent,
and, and I mean, there is just no way I've not picked one up.
No,
you don't, you don't sound like it to me.
I've only lived here about six years.
Oh, have you?
So, if I have one, it must be very, very slight.
Yeah.
The Yankees can hear it.
Yes.
Oh, that's true,
that's true.
I, see I don't think I do,
but, uh, but a lot of people do say I sound like,
I guess, I have, I guess more of a twang,  to  my voice almost a
Uh-huh.
Are you a, a native Texan?
I sure am.
Oh.
I've lived here all my life.
Well, good for you.
But, any way, uh,
Have you ever been to Austin?
Yes,
yes
we went last summer, actually.
This,
how was,
I'm wondering, I'm really not that not familiar.
I know there are some good places to go camping along the, uh, the lakes.
Or is there?
Okay,
well, we didn't go camping,
we just, uh, we did like, uh, we drove down to Houston to visit friends,
and,  we  went to Galveston and, uh, to San Antonio and then up to Austin. And, and kind of, uh, you know, doing the sight seeing type stuff.
Uh-huh.
So we didn't go camping.
That would be fun though to go.
That's one thing my husband wanted to do, was, on this summer's vacation was to go and camp wherever we went.
And I said, Well, I'd love that
but,
It takes a lot more planning.
It does,
and, and ever once, you know, on my summer vacation, you know, my week-long vacation, I,  want  to be a little bit pampered, you know, by a,  hotel  and a waiter
Uh-huh.
Right.
Exactly,
exactly,
yeah.
So, we're hoping to do like a three day weekend.
There's, um, a thing called Pfeiffer Rim.
I don't know if you have ever heard of it?
No,
I haven't.
It's, uh, there's a town called Glenrose.
I think it's around two hours from here.
And, uh, it's, it has like dinosaur tracks,  and stuff like  that
Oh, that sounds,  That sounds great.
and it's got one of those wildlife parks.
Yeah.
I think that'll be fun.
So we're going to try to do that like on a three day weekend, go there
and,
Have you ever camped out of state?
No,
I haven't.
You know, where you should try,  sometime is  Colorado.
Where at?
It is beautiful.
Is it?
Absolutely beautiful.
I've just been up there skiing,
and, well, we've driven through,
and,  you  know,
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
but,  but not, you know, camping or anything.
But I would love to camp,  in  the mountains.
Yes.
Estes State Park is fantastic.
That's what my girlfriend says.
Yes,
she loves that place.
See, you need to go there.
She loves that.
She says that where we need to go sometime.
It is. It's, you know, it's, it's high canyon
and, uh, and there's this little mountain lakes
and it's very peaceful.
Oh.
And, um, in, in the early fall time,
Uh-huh.
um,  I can't remember what type of trees they are,
but they, all the leaves turn yellow,
Oh.
and  it's just brilliant.
And,
I love that.
Yes,
you would.
You'd like it very much.
That's neat.
That's neat.
I know you would.
I used to go camping all the time as a, a Girl Scout.
I was too
All the time. I got real used to it then.
Yeah.
I felt like we roughed it then
Uh, well we did, you know,
we really did.
I mean, I just don't understand these people that think taking an R V,  and  parking it and sitting inside and watching T V,  and  having your microwave
Right.
Yes.
Exactly.
It's not  camping.
I mean, we had to make the fires and dig latrines and everything.
Right,
right.
I mean that is it
You have to get poison ivy and all that good stuff,  to  really be camping
Right.
Oh.
Yeah.
Well do you, you, you say you haven't been in years?
No,
I haven't.
I'm, um, I'm a struggling single mom.
Oh, gosh, bless your heart.
and, uh,
thank you.
Um, it's, you know,
time is precious,
money's precious.
Yes.
Um, and it, it,
I think I haven't been able to do it,
and, you know, what, that was one of the things I really thought I'd like to do with my children,  you know,  again.
Uh-huh,
uh-huh.
And I'm a little bit fearful of trying that just women.
I don't blame you.
You know?
I don't blame you at all.
I hope,
Years ago it would have been fine
but,
Yes,
I, I really now,
I, I have gone on one little vacation, just the girls and I.
We drove down to Port Aransas,  and  rented a little efficiency, you know,  and,  and had a marvelous like two nights,
Oh.
Yeah.
Yeah.
and  that was great.
And even at that, it, it was like the first time that I ventured,  you  know, out of the city by myself.
Uh-huh.
And, and, you know, I, I stayed in a nice place.
But it's still, it's real different not to have another adult with you.
Yes.
I
You know.
I can  imagine.
I'm just a chicken.
I know lots of women would do it all the time.
No
I don't blame you, not nowadays.
I haven't quite adjusted, you know?
Yeah.
Now are you with T I down there?
Well, I, I was with T I until January.
I, uh, I left T I in January hoping to strike out and find a job where I could make some money.
Good.
So, well it's, It was a good plan but I haven't yet
Have you?
Okay.
I got into sales,
and,  I'm  selling, uh, telephone systems.
Oh.
Oh, that's neat.
And it's, it's fun
and it's interesting,
but it's also, um, pretty challenging,
and I haven't, I haven't started making money yet.
Um. It's hard isn't it?
So, yeah,
it's, it's hard
Now, how old are your girls?
Eleven and fourteen.
Oh, goodness.
Yeah.
So I'm old
No,
you're not old
Who is You're not old at all.
Well, excuse me just second.
Sure.
speaks to Honey, I'll be

Oh, okay.
Do you need to go?
Well, um, I'm going to listen.
We always check and see if we should answer the door,  at  night.
Yeah.
That's very smart.
Yeah
so, well, I've enjoyed this.
Yeah,
me too.
And, uh,
And good luck.
How many have you made so far, calls?
I, I haven't made any.
I've been just a recipient
Oh, have you?
They're all,
this is only about my second one I've ever made.
I've been a recipient on the others.
How many have you had so far, do you know?
I think I've had about four.
Four,

yeah.
Very good.
That's four each.
Well, you know, when I had to

Yes.
and  it's like virtually anything.
I'll talk about anything to anybody
Yeah.
I don't,
yeah,
you bet,

And it's, it's been real interesting, the different personalities That I run across.
I know.
Yes,
I always try to find out where they're from,  you  know,
Exactly.
cause, because it is neat.
Uh-huh.
It really is.
Uh-huh.
Well then, I guess I'll let you go so you can go get the door
