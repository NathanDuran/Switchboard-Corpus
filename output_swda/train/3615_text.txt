Do you have any children?
Yeah,
I have two, two boys, twelve and sixteen.
Twelve and sixteen.
Uh-huh,
how about you?
Well, I have three,
and, uh, they're five and three and nineteen months.
Oh.
So we kind of got different ball game
but, uh.
Right
What, uh,
do you feel like you have any time, to spend with them?
Well.
They're probably at an age where they don't want to spend any time with their parents.
That's true
You actually, of course, spend less time with them when they get older,
but it's, of course, still really important.
Right.
I have a kind of a fortunate situation, I think, right now with my sixteen year old.
Um, I work two nights a week at a,
I'm a librarian
Oh, uh-huh.
and I work two nights a week at the Senior High School library.
They keep it open, you know, for kids to do their work
Right.
and he, um, and then they, the school district hires an aide, you know, to work for me.
Sure.
Well, my son is my aide.
Oh, well, that's nice.
So, two nights a week for four hours we're stuck together
You're stuck together.
and there's usually not very much business.
No.
I mean, some nights it's just real, real quiet.
So.
I would suspect your nights would be pretty quiet for the most part.
So we, I have sort of a captive audience,
so I really do spend probably more time with him than, than most, you know.
Right.
But, uh, of course I'm away from my other son those hours, too.
But his dad's at home pretty much that time.
And so that kind of gives him, uh, time with his dad, then.
Yeah,
that's true,
yeah.
Gives him a little bit of that individual time.
But, but it is hard, once they get that age,
I mean, their friends are the most important thing there is.
Right,
and they want to be able to spend, uh.
That's right.
Well, I've even noticed that with my five year old. She started kindergarten this year,
and every day that she's not at school, uh, she thinks we need to have someone over and play
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh
and that kind of
Yeah,
it's kind of hard.
yeah,
it's hard,
I think, uh, I find myself getting my little projects going and not taking the time that I should
Yeah.
I'm more worried about, Oh,
I didn't this done,
I didn't get,
the kitchen needs to be cleaned
Uh-huh.
this needs to be done,
and and I need to remind myself to slow down
Uh-huh.
and it'll still be there tomorrow.
Right.
Yeah,
that's true.
But that's kind of hard to do, you know.
Yes,
it is hard to do,
right,
yeah.
You don't see yourself getting.
Well, if you're kind of a person that likes things, you know, organized or neat
Uh-huh.
or, you know
Right.
then I think it, it is hard.
It's, um,
I think one of the nice things about holidays is that, you know, it does give you the opportunity to spend more time yeah, with family.
Slow down a little bit.
We have, we often go to Illinois for Christmas,
Oh, uh-huh.
and we're not this year,
and it's just really nice because we can do, you know, the things you want to do.
You can do, uh, more than than when you travel.
Yeah.
Yeah,
that's right.
This is the first year we're staying home, too,
and, uh, I think it's going to be real quiet
but, uh, that's an opportunity to get out the games
and,
Yeah,
right.
See, we usually do that,
my, my kids even have already gotten out, um,
my twelve year old got out the Legos which of course he hasn't touched since last summer
Right.
Of of course.
but, you know, but every now and then, I mean, he's got a lot of those technic, those hard kind,
you know, and he wants to be an engineer,
so he still likes all that kind of building stuff
Oh, yeah.
and, um, we have the train,
and we haven't had that Lego train together for years,
and, um, so he sat down,
and I told him I really wanted him to build the train,
and we would put it under the tree, and that I would keep it together,
I wouldn't take it apart
Wouldn't take it apart after that.
yeah,
and every year I'd have the Lego train under the tree.
That'd be kind of fun.
And, um, so he worked on that for the longest time, ever since school was out on Friday,
and, um, then his sixteen year old brother started helping, too, you know.
you know, these are kind of things like during the normal rat race
Right,
right.
those kinds of things never happen
No
but.
no.
In fact in, I think if people would learn to turn off the T V
and
Uh-huh.
Yeah.
I think that's a lot of the breakdown of the communication and the communication that would take place in a family,
Yes,
yeah.
Which is,
usually people are not sitting in front of that.
Uh-huh,
and there's always a few people in the family that, when they stare at it, you know, they're totally turned off to everything else.
The rest of.
Yes,
and you can't communicate while you're doing that, right?
No
That's right.
Whereas, uh, I'm the type of person, I could not sit, well,
I shouldn't say I could not,
but be very hard for me to sit down and watch a program all the way through without doing something.
Yeah,
yeah,
me too.
Yeah,
Because they talk so much,
isn't that the,
they talk about T V shows,
and I, huh,
you know, how can you watch that, you know
You're kind of like, what are you talking about
and, uh,
it's the best show on,
I don't know.
You feel like you're a little bit out of it, don't you.
They need to have a highlight in the newspaper or something tell us what's,
