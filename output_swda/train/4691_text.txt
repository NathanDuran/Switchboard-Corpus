Oh so ,
Okay.
I'm not as ashamed to claim them this year as I have been so
Well, it,
let's put  it this way.
We've got the New England Patriots up here
so.
Oh yeah.
Right. Well,
They've had some serious problems in the past couple of years.
Really?
Yeah.
Why?
Um, well, uh, partly due to ownership.
You know, uh, Victor Kiam owned the, uh, the Patriots uh, for a period of a number of years
Uh-huh.
and he always had this, uh, this wonderful quality of being able to put his foot in his mouth every time he went to say something
and, uh, they've had some financial problems with the team and so forth.
And it recently was sold to, uh, some other people
so, hopefully, this ownership can set up new direction and, uh, keep, uh, the Patriots in the New England area anyways
Yeah.
Well it will be fun for you to watch up there anyway  to  see what happens now you,
Oh,  yeah.
I've been to a couple, I've been to a few games before.
Uh-huh.
Now you, you're, you're from Texas.
Right.
So you've got two football teams down there.
Well, it depends on where you're from in Texas.
I live right by Dallas so we have one football team  as far as we're  concerned
Uh-huh.
Oh, I see.
That's how it is.
There's that type of segregation, huh?
It's divided,
yeah.
Wow!
It really is,
so we've got our Cowboys here
and and, uh, I don't think anybody roots differently
Uh-huh.
but  I have  a boyfriend that lives in Fresno
Do you,
and he is for the L, the, uh, Raiders. L A Raiders,
Uh-huh.
so.
Do you follow professional sports at all?
Well, I just started to this year because of these silly Raiders that didn't do very well
but I've been trying more this year.
I think I know a little more than I use to.
Yeah.
I never  knew very much at all
so I'm trying
Well, it's a good past time,  you know.
Yeah.
Particularly football.
They say, uh, football attracts more men because of the, you know, the, you see the, the physical aggression on the field
and supposedly, psychologists say that, uh, that, uh, men take out their frustrations by watching football
and, you know, they get together with a bunch of guys
and they, uh, uh, and they have a good time and everything
and that's suppose to be some of the, uh, the male bonding and the, and the, uh, the male instincts, I guess, or something about  the, uh,
So  I shouldn't even try to do it, huh
Well, no.
It, it's good as, in terms of, in terms of, uh, of a contest.
Yes.
I  think that, uh,
I personally like hockey better because it has contact, it's a contact sport.
It has the speed.
Right.
And the hand eye coordination
and it takes a certain skill to play hockey.
Not everybody can play hockey.
Yeah.
So we,
and
that's,
we're a big hockey area up here,
I bet up here in New England as well as, you know, in, in the Minnesota area
Really .
but,
I don't even think we have that in Texas.
What, hockey?
We might.
Do we?
I mean,  no
you probably know,
I don't know.
No,
there's no hockey,
there's no
Nobody talks about it
so I don't think we do.
There's no professional hockey teams in,  in Texas
No,
uh-huh.
And we have a soccer team that comes and goes.
We don't even have that very much,
so.
Yeah.
I think though that professional football in particular, is becoming so diluted now.
Uh-huh.
Like they have this World Football League.
You see, we have the N F L that, that Dallas and Houston are in and New England Patriots and L A Raiders and those teams
Yeah.
There are those teams that play in professional, National Football League
but, uh, now they have what's called the World Football League
and they have all these teams from,
there's a team in London
and there's a team   there, there's, uh, teams, other European teams
Oh.
and there's teams in the United States
and they're playing now during the summer months
and it's really you know, overkill
Oh yeah.
And  there's only so much football you can watch.
Yeah.
Well, I like to do,
I don't like to watch.
Yeah,
that's good.
I don't like  to watch anything.
So it kind of annoys me when people just lay in front of a T V and watch  all this stuff.
I think it's an,  excuse to do nothing
and I, I can see what you're saying about the male bonding
and the  guys get together
Yeah.
and that's kind of cool.
That's fun, you know.
Uh-huh.
But it can get really  overdone.
Now,  have you ever been to a professional football game?
Yeah,
I have.
Have you?
Yeah,
yeah,
I have.
Did you do the whole big, the whole thing, the tailgate party and  the whole,
Uh, no
actually,  no.
Well  see, now see that's what you got to do, see.
Now we talked our,
I've done that for  college football.
Yeah,
yeah.
Yeah.
You, the,
well the same thing.
Yeah.
We, we talked our wives,
there's about six or eight guys that we use to go out for these games.
And, uh, we talked our wives into going with us one time
and they had a real good time
and it was, basically, for the social atmosphere.
Right.
And that's  the thing, you know.
You go, you know  three or four hours before the game.
You go set up.
We set a table up,
we do some cooking, some barbecueing, have a few drinks and then go in and see the game and see the Patriots lose and then  go home and eat, drink some more.
Yeah.
But, but that whole,
it, it's not so much, sure the contest itself and the game itself,
Yeah.
that you miss sitting home in your parlor, you know, uh, with, with a six pack of beer and some, uh, potato chips,  you know
That's right.
you, you miss that.
Yeah,
that's right.
And, and any professional sport I think, you miss that.
Uh-huh.
The atmosphere of being there,  you know.
Yeah.
Well, in high school I went to every football game
and, well, I twirled, you know.
Yep.
And I,  you know, I didn't,
I still don't know that much about football, obviously.
But I still had a good time. You know,
Well
