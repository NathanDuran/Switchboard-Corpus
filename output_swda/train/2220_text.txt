I was trying to think about some of my favorite people that I liked in music
and they're, none of them are recent, right.
Uh-huh.
So I like Gordon Lightfoot,
do you know who he is?
Yeah
And the Moody Blues,
and I like to listen to piano music a whole lot,
and Willie Nelson.
Uh-huh.
So you like a, a variety.
Yeah.
Sort of easy listening because you like country
but then,
But not all country.
I don't like that, when they start,
Um.
I don't know.
I just like Willie Nelson I guess because he's such a character.
Oh, uh-huh.
Yeah,
I, I like some of his songs, though.
They're, they're not so, they're not so sad country all the time.
They're just kind of sweet sometimes.
Yeah.
You know, I mean they're not the, the typical country where they're just, you know, my wife left me, my dog left me, you know
My truck is broken down.
Yeah,
my truck's broken down
and my house just burned down, you know.
Yeah.
But,
There, there's a guy,
have you ever heard of George Winston,
he plays piano.
No.
I think he's dead now,
but he plays wonderfully.
Uh-huh.
I like that.
Are, are you, do you play the piano,
is,
or you just like it?
Very badly.
I've got a piano,
Yeah.
my mother got a piano
and, uh, vowed that someone in the family was going to learn,
so we all had to take lessons,
and I was the one that did the least poorly,
so she gave it to me.
And it's sitting here mostly taking up space,
but sometimes it makes you feel good to sit down and play it.
It is real relaxing.
Yeah,
it must be fun to be able to play it
and, you know, if you can play tunes that people can sing along to it'd be, it'd be kind of fun, I think.
Yeah.
because I mean, I play the flute
and not many things you can play that'll, you know, people will sit there and sing along to
and you can't sing along either
so, but, uh, I like a lot, uh,
I like classical music just because of the,
when, I, I don't play,
I like jazz music
but
Oh, so do I.
What's that?
Forgot about that.
What's that?
I said so do I,
I forgot about jazz
Yeah,
I like a lot, like,
I like, uh, is it the New Age music, like with, uh, uh, the,
I don't know if you've heard Neurotic Collection.
Yes,
we've got about five of those.
I love them.
Yeah,
I love those, too.
They're just so relaxing.
Uh-huh.
I'd never heard them before until I went in a music store
and you know how you put the headphones on and listen to it
Yeah.
and I just, I heard a piece
and it was just so wonderful.
Yeah.
And then even my eleven year old boy loves to listen to it.
Isn't that nice.
I mean it's nice when you have a piece that, that is so, so peaceful, that everybody likes, you know,
Yeah.
and, uh, it, it, it, it, you know, it has pieces that are uplifting,
but, it, it's mostly relaxing
and you don't, because it doesn't have words, you know, you don't feel like, there's anything you have to remember, you know, as far as singing a song or something like that or interpreting what they mean
or, but, uh,
I mean you can just sit,
you know those little booklets that come along with it
Yeah.
and you can just see the things that they're trying to show with music.
Yeah.
My, my little boy has gotten so into it that
he's identified the, the people that have written certain songs,
then he buys the pieces that have that person. You know, on it.
Yeah.
Oh, I see what you're saying.
Huh?
Yeah.
I mean, I don't even know who did which ones,
but he does.
I, I can't identify them either.
I just like them.
I could, I know which ones come next,
but I don't even know their names.
Most of them I don't know their names of the song,
but I, I can identify them.
But I like that
and I like, uh, course I, I like classical music.
Yeah.
And, uh,
Were you in the band?
I was in the band,
yeah
So was I.
and I was in, like, chamber music groups and stuff,
so I'm used to pieces
and, and I played classical flute,
I didn't play, play jazz flute or anything like that,
so. I I can relate to it, I suppose
But, uh, and I like, I'm like you I like the older stuff, too,
because I like Chicago
Yeah.
and I like I like, uh, uh, let me think who, uh,
you don't know Hebert Laws,
but Hebert Laws a flute player,
he's a jazz flute player
and I like, uh, uh, Chuck Mangione,
do you know who Chuck Mangione is?
Yeah.
Yeah,
I like Chuck Mangione
Trying to think of all, uh, oh,
what's his name, plays the trumpet. Yeah.
I like the Moody Blues.
Did you like them?
Yeah,
I like Moody Blues.
I, I like mostly the older groups I think.
Oh,
but we do have,
I like Simply Red,
we got Simply Red.
I figure all our C Ds that we have what I really like
And, uh, I like Breeze,
I like the group.
I think just because they all sort of sound, they sound a lot like uh, Simply Red. Uh.
So what type, Simply Red,
I've never heard of that.
Is it just instrumental?
No,
it's, it's got people singing,
but it's it is instrumental.
But it's, it's got people singing
but it's got a, like a whole bunch of people singing.
Yeah.
You know, how many people are in Simply Red, Stuart to someone else in the
he can't hear me.
I, I don't remember how many people,
but, it's, it's got men and women
and it's not, it's, it's nice,
I mean it's pleasant, you know, music.
It's not where it's, it hurts your ears to hear it.
But it's not as, it's not like, uh, Chicago where it's got that much instrument to it.
You know, it doesn't have, like all the brass and everything.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Well my husband is telling me we have to hit the road
We're going to go to Commerce and see a friend.
And, then I'm going to go to Sulphur Springs.
Oh, you must live in this area.
Yeah,
where are you?
We're in Sherman.
Okay.
So we're in Garland.
Oh, okay.
You're going to Commerce?
Yeah
For East Texas or something?
Yeah,
yeah.
Oh, okay.
Just because there's a friend up there,
not because there's much else
Oh, okay.
Well they're having a lot of recruiting this week in all the different areas.
That's why I was just
For colleges?
Yeah,
East Texas is recruiting for, you know, their fall semester
Well, they're not
and they're, they've been doing a lot of that in the area.
They're not going to recruit me anymore,
I'm through.
No more for me.
No more, huh.
What, what do you do?
Well, right now I'm just a homemaker,
but I'm going to school, uh, for legal assistant
and that's what I know,
so, and, uh, just nothing basically
Are you going to go to East Texas for that?
No,
no,
it,
no
I don't go to East Texas.
I got a degree from T W U,
but I'm really interested in legal, you know, in the legal environment,
but I don't want to be a lawyer
so I said well, I think I'll go back to school and see about being a legal assistant.
That'd probably be pretty interesting.
I was summonsed down to the courthouse last week.
They had summonsed eight hundred people,
about four hundred showed up,
and it was for a murder trial.
Oh, uh-huh.
This guy had supposedly, uh, strangled this woman and stuffed cotton toweling down her throat and up her nose
Anyway, this is happened in nineteen eighty-three.
Yeah.
And they had us fill out a long questionnaire.
We stayed till about one thirty
and they're going to call the ones that they're interested in from the questionnaire two to three at a time
and the trial won't take place until June.
Yeah,
that's how it works.
And they say it's going to last about two to three weeks.
And this guy in front of me said, I can't believe I was summonsed.
I was an investigator
and I was tailing the woman that was killed.
Well, then I have a friend at school that has a boyfriend that's a lawyer
and he said that this woman this socialite in Plano had hired four guys to kill her husband
and the one that's accused was the one that actually did it.
And she has since taken off with another lawyer who had been, uh, getting cocaine from his client and then selling it,
and he had skipped bail
and they finally extradited him
and he's going to testify for the State against her so he'll have his sentence reduced.
And this is the man that was in front of you?
Yeah.
Oh, well they'll, weed him out.
The, the investigator.
Yeah,
he, he got off right away.
Yeah.
And I wrote that down on my questionnaire that he'd told me that,
Uh-huh.
so I figure that that will make me biased
and I won't be chosen.
Well, not necessarily
Hopefully
but there's probably something else that might make you.
Because you could know about, you could know about the crime, but not necessarily be taken off the jury, you know, not be accepted for the jury.
Yeah. No. *aa
I mean, pretty much a lot of people would know about it, you know, and, and know some of the different things about it
but, uh, they, they might weed you out some other way.
You know, if you, if you don't believe, like if this was a capital crime and, and you don't believe in if you don't believe in death penalty, you're not going to be picked at all.
So but,
I said that, I could believe in it in certain instances, but I would be, I'd find it hard to levy that against somebody.
Yeah,
so, see, there, there they would have a doubt about you, that, you know,
You know.
Uh-huh.
because if that's what, if that's what the punishment is in that, in that instance, then you're always going to say, you know, not
you're, you're not going to want to have him have that uh, that punishment.
So,
Yeah.
But then when you're, when you're picked,
see I was picked for another murder trial before
Uh-huh.
oh, gosh and it's so hard because, you know, everybody is wanting to go on and get the sentence done,
and if you're trying to hold out, you know, there's so much pressure on you
and you've got to come up with a decision.
Well, especially with something where you have to you have to find it beyond a reasonable doubt.
You have to find whether they're guilty beyond a reasonable doubt
and it's like, do you really feel that sure about,
