All right
so, uh, you live in Dallas?
Yes,
I live in Dallas.
Now I understand that, um, the, the real estate market out there has really gone crazy, up and down, up and down.
Yeah,
I think right now it's, it's kind of bad Uh,
I don't live in a house,
I live in an apartment
Oh.
Are, are you in a house?
Yeah,
uh-huh.
Okay.
Yeah,
we have a single family home in northern Virginia just outside of Washington.
Uh-huh.
Well, I guess the best I can do is, is, uh, compare apartments
If it can compare the one that I have now, with the one that I had the last time, the one that I have now, uh, has a lot more amenities, I guess is the right word, than the one that I moved out of.
Uh, this one, you know, gave us free cable and, uh, ceiling fans
and, uh, it was practically new when I moved in here
and the carpet was new
and,
Huh.
Do you live in the high-rise?
No,
it's not a high-rise.
It's just a, a two story building.
Uh-huh.
Uh, but there's, you know, there, there are a lot of buildings
but it's just two stories.
Uh, on the second floor they have, they don't have a patio
but they have a sunroom instead of the patio.
On the first floor, um, where I am, there's a patio.
Oh, okay.
So, so you just, you have one floor all to yourself?
Yeah.
Oh, okay.
The rooms are nice and large
and, let's see, I have, I have two bedrooms.
And, uh, ,
Oh, that's nice.
Do you get your own washer, dryer?
Well, I, I, I have a washer and dryer area
and I, I did buy the washer and dryer,
but they didn't provide it.
Oh.
The one that I moved from didn't, didn't have a place to put them,
and that's one of the reasons that I did move.
Yeah.
That is nice.
Yeah.
Get tired of dragging clothes to the laundromat
Yeah.
So, tell me
Yeah,
I've always, uh, been pretty lucky.
The real estate out here's been pretty good.
It, uh, the, the prices of, well, the prices came down last year.
We've, we had sort of like a Dallas syndrome
Yeah.
The past, uh, uh, year and a half prices have gone down which is totally new for northern Virginia.
Uh-huh.
It just , It's a real good ,
It just never happened before.
So it's really surprising everybody.
All the developers don't know what to do
Yeah,
it's a good time to buy, if you're in the market.
Yeah,
we're, uh, we actually have our house on the market because we have two kids
Uh-huh.
and we have a three bedroom house.
And it's pretty much filled up right now.
Oh, so you want a bigger one.
Yeah,
uh-huh.
Get an extra bedroom or a basement.
Right now it's just a, a single level rambler.
Uh-huh.
One thing about the houses in, uh, in Dallas, they don't, uh, utilize basements the way they did in New York.
My parents in New York had, uh, a, uh, three family house.
Uh-huh.
Actual a,
two family house where the, the, um, the downstairs and the second floor they had,
and then they rented the third floor with the whole apartment, you know.
Oh.
And, uh, they had a basement,
and they, you know, they finished the basement,
and they were able to rent that out also.
But, uh, in Dallas I, I just, I just haven't seen basements in houses.
Yeah,
yeah.
And I've looked at a lot of them, you know .
Yeah,
a friend of mine was thinking about coming down there,
and that's what he said was that, you know, it just wasn't something that people had down there.
No,
it's
They put pools and garages on, but, uh, no basements
Right.
I haven't, I haven't, I have yet to see a basement in a house.
Huh.
And, uh,
Maybe it's all the sand.
Is there a lot of sand in,
I always think it's like a desert,
I don't know.
Dallas always,
Well, no.
No,
no,
no,
you know, I don't see that kind of sand here. Um,
there are some areas though where, where they have a problem with, uh, the houses kind of sinking a little bit into the, to the, uh,
Uh-huh.
or the foundation is sinking or something. You know, just a little, just a little bit, some more than others.
But you, you have to know the right spot, to, to pick where that doesn't happen.
Yeah.
And, uh ,
Well, out here we, um, we live in what used to be, uh, like a prairie or whatever a natural, you know, natural grasslands.
Uh-huh.
And, uh, they,
it's just, you go down four inches
and you get to well, fourteen inches you get to sandstone.
Yeah.
And so any place where they put a basement in they had to blast
I see.
It's just solid sandstone.
Huh.
Where did you say you're at, Colorado?
No,
Virginia.
Virginia,
Virginia.
That's right .
Yeah,
it's sort of unusual really.
Most of Virginia is clay.
Anywhere near, uh, Virginia Beach?
Oh, yeah,
uh-huh.
Yeah.
My, uh, my folks used to live there.
Back before I was born, they lived there.
Oh.
Uh-huh.
Well, different areas in Dallas have different kind,
in, uh, in Texas I'll say
because down in east Texas there's a lot of red clay.
Uh-huh.
And, uh, in the, in the Dallas, you know, Fort Worth city areas you don't see that.
Yeah,
well, uh, Texas is a big state
so I imagine the, the type of houses and, uh, things like that are truly different from area to area
Yeah,
well,
But, uh, that's the same way out here
because, um, well, we, for example, and we live fifteen miles from the beltway that surrounds Washington
Uh-huh.
and anything instead that beltway, the highway, the real estate's forty thousand dollars more expensive.
Yeah.
So, you know, you really can't afford, I, I, I could never afford a house inside the beltway.
That's why we came out here.
This is called the, the, the country, you know, with only, you know, maybe twenty miles total from D C, twenty-five from the city.
Huh.
But, um, it's considered the country since it's, uh, you know, that far out.
Well ,
But, um, yeah,
we live out by Dulles Airport.
I see.
Yeah,
and, uh, that's one of the few places still in northern Virginia
they have trailer parks that are down around the corner from here
and, you know, it's, it's still pretty rural.
Uh-huh.
Uh, not too much of northern Virginia is like that anymore.
Land has gotten so expensive
they just can't afford to have low income housing like that.
So, is your house in an area by itself?
I mean,
No,
we're in a development.
it's not connected to another one?
There's, uh,
yeah,
there's another one half an acre away, or a quarter acre away rather.
Oh.
But it's not, they're not connected are they?
Oh, no.
Huh-uh.
You have to, uh, stay in one single family home.
I sort of got spoiled with that when I was growing up.
Yeah.
Uh, my folks, um, had an apartment for a while when we were kids
but, um, for the most part they, they always had, you know,
and Pennsylvania always had a single family home
and so, you know, as soon as we could we, we got a single family home,
Uh-huh.
and that's all I ever knew growing up,
Uh-huh.
so. I stayed in a townhouse for, uh, two years and then, uh, saved up enough money to, to get a,
