kids too?
Yeah  .
Oh, you laugh.
How many,
what ages?
Well, twenty-seven up.
Uh.
And we had five.
You've been through the fun part
Oh, yeah.
And how about yourself?
I have a four and a half and a three.
Oh.
well.
So.  It's,
I, I'm sure there's a lot of differences in the way, in the way it's done now and then.
Yeah.
Well, when mine were growing up, I did some traveling and but not that extensively
but I always just made it a point, you know, to spend about ten minutes with each one of them.
Yeah.
So it was an hour,  you know.
Yeah.
But whether it was going back and laying in bed with them and just shooting the breeze or whatever, telling them stories or reading to them.
What was the age difference between the youngest and the oldest?
Six years.
So they were all real close?
Yeah.
That's tough.
That's a lot of  time.
Oh, yeah.
We look back and wonder how we did it.
Did you both work? Your wife too?
No,
she never did.
Uh, well,  qualify that.
She worked at home, I'm  sure
Well, yeah,
yeah.
But that's, uh,
well both my husband and I work
and sometimes I feel like, you know, by the time I pick them up and get them home and get them fed, I have very little time each evening.
Yeah.
Maybe thirty minutes max.
Well that's plenty  though.
And  well he spends a lot of time with them while I'm cooking
and then I spend time with them while, you know, he's doing other stuff.
And, and, of course, we try to spend a lot of time on the weekend.
You know, there's a lot of times my house may not be as clean as I particularly like it
but it's neat,
it's straight
and I can live with it  because  I do stuff with my kids, you know.
Yeah.
Right.
Well, you know, with kids you're not going to have a neat house.
Well, I've accepted that too
And, you know  it, it's tough to find time. especially with both of them working.
That's true.
It is.
Yeah.
That's true.
And you just have to set the time and say, okay this is going to be it.
Well, that's true
and, and we do a lot of that on the weekends, you know.
We try to spend Saturdays together.
Right.
If my husband golfs, you know, he'll do it during nap time, things like that where they're not really missing the presence, you know.
Right.
And, and we do a lot of family things together.
We're, we're kind of going the other direction this weekend.
We're planning a trip, just he and I.
This is the first time we've gone anywhere without the kids  since she was born  four and a half years ago.
Well that's good too.
Yeah,
that's good that way too
Well, I decided that, you know, you need that once in awhile. That you, you need to plan the quality time
and, and I do think that if you plan it and spend that and make it quality time you don't have to be there twenty-four hours a day.
Yeah.
Well, that, they say it, it, all it takes is about five, ten minutes a day.
Yeah.
And, you know, and as the kids got older I made them, you know, help me cut the grass and kind of made that a project too. Or whatever
Sure.
Sure.
and,
And they think that's a family activity, you know.
Oh, yeah.
Yeah.
That's great fun
And, uh, well, yeah,
if,
My daughter's like, Mommy can I help you with the laundry?
Of course, you can
Yeah.
Just keep them talking that way.
Absolutely.
Yeah
But, uh, another thing we used to do is have family councils. Every Sunday night.
Uh-huh.
And what would you do,
what?
Discuss everything that didn't agree with them.
And we'd take turns being president.
Oh.
And everyone would get one vote.
And I always thought we'd get outvoted five to two
Yeah.
but it never worked that way.
So they would just pick whatever issue  kind of was at a  head that week
Yeah.
Well and we could bring up  and we could bring up stuff too.
and then,
Oh.
And that was always good time.
Boy, we really got to know the kids well.
I imagine.
And I imagine you still have a very close relationship with them.
Oh, yeah.
In  fact, they were all in, uh, over the weekend for Easter.
I,
Oh, that's wonderful.
See I was raised in that type of family where, you know, you don't disobey me, you mind me
but if you have a problem with what we did or how we did it, you can always come back and talk to me about it.
Well, we did too.
Yeah.
And I remember the one daughter saying, we had a, a friend of hers that used to drive us up a tree
Uh-huh.
and she said, hey I don't make fun fun of your friends
so why make fun of mine?
Uh  well.
Kind of  kind of hit us between the eyes.
Yeah,
yeah.
You don't think of it that way do you
No.
But that, that was always good quality time for us.
Now that's good.
I like  that idea.
And then  never attend,
but if, if they missed it, they had to abide by the rules.
Whatever was voted on, huh.
Yeah
and boy, they, they'd show up.
Well I think that's great.
And we'd usually take notes
Yeah.
and, you know, the younger kids, uh, or maybe all of them needed help at one time or another.
Yeah.
And, uh, but they were usually tougher on themselves than they were on us.
And they loved it.
I, I think that's true.
I can remember times my parents would say well what do you think would be a fair punishment.
Yeah.
And we would always come up with something that was harder than what they would have done you know.
Yeah.
So I do think it's right that they're harder on themselves,  you know.
Yeah.
But, uh, boy, I, I feel for you and  your husband.
Oh,  why is that?
Well, my, my, uh, two of my, uh,
