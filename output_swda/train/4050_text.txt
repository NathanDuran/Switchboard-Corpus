Hello.
I pressed the button one,
so we're recording right now.
I'm sorry
That's okay.
I'm Bill from Raleigh.
Okay,
and I'm Melanie from Harrisville, Utah.
Oh, another one from a different state besides Texas.
Yeah.
Um, okay,
Bill, we're talking about family reunions.
Right.
Okay, um,
have you ever had to plan a family reunion?
Uh, yes
and no,
it wasn't really a a planning one,
but it was kind of, uh, it was a birthday
Oh.
and I brought a lot of family together then.
Uh-huh.
And how did you feel it went?
It went pretty good.
I'm, I've worked in hotels,
so I, I kind of know how to do these things.
Oh.
I used to, you know.
All this planning and, and getting together and such.
Um, oh, let's see what else.
Usually when we have kind of our family reunion it's my grandmother's birthday,
and and it's all of like, she, she comes from a big family.
Uh-huh.
She has like seven sisters I think.
Oh, boy
They show up and all their kids.
And then all, she has, uh,
I have like, uh,
let's see,
she has four sons and two daughters,
and they show up and all their kids,
Uh-huh.
so it's a pretty big reunion,
it's about two hundred people, maybe.
Oh, my word.
Well, what did you find was most helpful in planning the birthday get together?
Um, the, probably the biggest challenge was getting a place where everyone, you know, could eat comfortably and, and everything, uh.
Uh-huh.
I guess probably the most helpful thing was that, um, for the rent, we rented like a, a rescue squad building or something like that.
Oh.
Uh-huh.
And, uh, each one of the, everybody that showed up donated some money for the rent and for, for like soft drinks
and and so nobody like really got stuck with the bill.
Oh.
Oh, that's good.
And each person in the family, you know, brought a dish, or something.
Uh-huh,
and then did you have a main meal,
or did everyone just bring,
it  was just pot luck.
It was kind of  pot luck.
Uh-huh.
You know, everybody brought their specialties, I guess you would say.
Yeah,
yeah,
show off a little bit
Yeah.
And of course my grandmother's food was, as always, gone first because she's such a great cook.
Oh.
Oh.
Now how old is she?
Uh, she's eighty-six.
Oh, goodness.
Is she pretty spry, is she, you know, pretty.
Now she does,
she looks probably like she's in her early sixties
Oh, wow.
and if she didn't have arthritis, she'd get around better than me as a matter of fact
Uh-huh.
Oh.
Oh, that's neat, that she's in good health, and that, at that age.
Yeah.
Oh, yeah.
My nickname for her is Honey Woman.
That's what I call her.
Really.
Well that sounds fun.
Well, I I had a real challenge of planning a family reunion a few years ago,
and there were,
we sent out five hundred, uh, announcements, because our family is quite large, like your, your family there.
And so that was a real challenge,
and I was president of our family reunion for two years,
and I wasn't very at that duty, for two years in a row,
but I found that advance planning was the key to success.
Uh, also one thing that's helpful,
and I don't know if your family's spread out or whatever
Uh-huh.
but most of, all my family lives like in the same county
so
Oh, that's wonderful, though
But it's just kind of like get on the telephone
and, it's so and such days from such and such date
Oh.
and everybody just shows up.
Oh, well, that is, that is helpful.
Yeah,
our family ranges from, oh, goodness, well, Australia,
I have a brother lives in Australia, to, uh, Boise, Idaho, and, and, uh, all kinds of places.
I would say you're spread out, then.
We are
Uh, my immediate family, you know, my, my parents and my brothers and sisters, I guess we're the ones that have the gypsy blood or whatever,
because my dad was in the Army
and we're we're pretty strung out all over.
Oh.
But since they've moved back to Carolinas, we still are the only ones do not live in in Yantsen County.
In.
Oh.
I live in Raleigh,
and then my, my parents live in Greenville,
and I have one brother and his wife live in Greenville, and, uh, another brother that lives in, outside of Fayetteville.
Uh-huh.
So I mean, we're, we're spread out,
but everybody else is centralized in, in, my home town, Waynesboro
Boy.
so.
Oh, my gosh.
Nobody moves away except us
They must really like it there.
Yeah,
I got out as soon as I graduated.
Yeah.
Oh.
Just like this town is too small for me,
Good-bye.
Oh, you're ready to move on to
