Okay?
Yes.
Well, this is a very timely topic inasmuch as we're going to a family reunion this weekend.
Oh are you really?
Yeah.
Where is it going to be?
Down at Lake Texoma lodge.
Oh.
Yes,
this is one that's, uh, the Baker family reunion
Uh-huh.
and this has been going on at least, uh, I would say, at least twenty-five years or thirty,  something like that.
Oh, that's  marvelous.
Maybe longer than that, I'm going to get back into the fifties sometime.
Uh-huh.
First time, I, I married into the family,
and the first time I went was about fifty-seven, I think.
Uh-huh.
But, uh, this one has been well organized
and in fact it used to be at Lake Brownwood,
and now it's Lake Texoma, because that's more central location for people from Oklahoma and Texas to come to.
Uh-huh.
I'm sure location's really important as far as figuring out where one ought to be.
Very important, because, uh, you'll start losing people if it's too far to go.
Uh-huh.
We have factions, when it's one part,
we, I have one reunion on my mother's side,
and we found that if it's in a certain part of Texas, some people come,
and if it's elsewhere, other people come
Yeah.
we never get them at both of them
Never get them at both places,
it seems like,
so I think we need to find a new place
Right.
Well, listen, they've, uh, they've had this one,
well it just,
of course, over the years it has, uh, built up as far as the organization is concerned
Uh-huh.
but now they, uh, have a golf tournament on the Saturday.
Um.
And then they have generally a show or an auction or something on Saturday night to help raise funds to cover the costs of such.
Oh, that's a neat idea.
Yeah,
and, uh, everyone, uh, they get the community building there at Lake Texoma lodge,
and everyone brings in food
Uh-huh.
and then for the Saturday night dinner they bring in like Kentucky Fried Chicken from Durant,
and uh it really, uh, has worked out.
Uh-huh.
How many people, Jim, are involved?
Uh, generally, uh, I think it's been as high as about a hundred and twenty people.
Wow.
I think normal's about sixty or seventy.
Yeah,
well, I guess, um, ours probably isn't that big.
Our family is dwindling, for one thing.
Oh
And I often feel funny because I'm in a branch that's all but died
Oh.
I just have one aunt and my family.
So sometimes when these other families get together, they're really pulling in aunts and uncles and grandkids,
Yeah.
and we're kind of off on the sidelines.
But it does remind us that we have family and roots.
Right.
So we keep going even though we're not a real big part of it.
Yeah,
well, our family reunion started out my wife
and I were the kids, the newlyweds, so to speak
Uh-huh.
and now we go, our children go,
and our grandchildren are going now.
Oh that's great.
So it's, uh, wound up that, uh, we're the old folks now.
Uh-huh,
uh-huh.
But, um, they have various organized,
they have generally a volleyball net set up and horseshoes, uh, to pitch,
and they organize a baseball game for the kids
Uh-huh.
and several people bring boats,
and there's a place they, they take the kids up to the lodge and go swimming up there in the afternoon,
so it it's a full day.
So there's lots to do.
Some of the people come down on Friday afternoon and spend the whole weekend,
Uh-huh.
and some just come in for Saturday
Uh-huh.
so, it, uh, has worked out quite well,
and it's a chance to see some of the relatives you don't see all year long except that once a year.
Uh-huh
that's true.
Well, that's neat.
I think, think they're really fun.
We go to mine regularly,
and then we go to my husband's occasionally down in Temple,
and he has a large family,
so it's, it's fun when we go to that one.
Yeah,
my side of the family is from back in Ohio and West Virginia,
and I think we've been to one in thirty-five years or something like that,
so, That's just too far away.
Oh.
Yeah,
yeah
that, that is a problem with the distance.
The people that we have that don't come are out El Paso way
Yeah.
and it's just too much for all of them,  all of that group to travel.
It's an,  all day drive just to  get to this area.
Right.
But then we have the same attitude when it's out, there, although this year we're going out.
They're going to have it at Fort Davis
Yeah.
and we thought that would be fun to kind of tie it in as a vacation time as well as reunion.
Yeah.
Yeah,
we have,
each year, of course, they elect officers of the family reunion
Uh-huh.
and a number of years ago, back in the early eighties, my wife was president.
We discovered how much work it is just to organize and get it together. And it takes a lot of planning,  and assembling of stuff.
Uh-huh.
And choose,  some place that everybody's  going to like as far as food and all that
Right.
That's correct.
That's a heavy burden.
Yes,
it is,
I tell you.
I don't really care for her to be president again.
No
But that is, uh, it's, it's a lot of work,
but it's a lot of fun.
Uh-huh.
We've enjoyed it,
and the grandkids really enjoy it because it's the only time of the year they see all their cousins from Oklahoma.
Well, I think,
Yeah,
and it's, it's good for kids to know that they have other family.
Yeah,
and this year they're all excited.
The show this weekend,
this weekend's going to be a rock and roll show
Oh, boy.
my two grandsons and one of their cousins are, are going to dress up and lip sing to a rock song you know, in jeans and t-shirts and such.
Oh, what fun.
Uh-huh.
So, it's, uh, it's going to be exciting for them, and for us too.
Uh-huh.
Probably lots of laughs.
Oh, yes,
there have been some really wild shows put on there.
They, uh, really get, uh, into it.
Uh-huh.
Well, it sounds like you really have a good structure and have it going along.
Ours, ours is still kind of loosely organized,
and the same people usually get stuck with doing it.
Yeah,
well,  Oh, that generally happens.
And,  they do it as a labor of love.
Yeah.
So, the officer idea is a good idea.
Yeah,
well we've, uh, had various things over the years, uh, to raise funds for it
Uh-huh.
and again, it's not, it's not cheap to rent the lodge up there or the meeting room down in the cabins and such,
Yeah.
but, uh they've come up with,
Uh-huh
they've tried passing the hat,
and they've had auctions and various things to raise funds,
and, uh some people do
Uh-huh.
and some people don't
Yeah,
and it's not fair that everybody not contribute,
Excuse me. But, um, anyway, that's the family reunion story.
Uh-huh.
Okay.
Well, thanks a lot I enjoyed  talking to you.
Bye.
Been nice talking  to you.
Bye.
