Well, uh, guess it's logical to ask, do you exercise any?
Well, unfortunately very little.
Uh, much less than what I need to.
I'm about the same way,
I, I do a little bit.
My job kind of hinders me from exercising.
I'm a night operator here at a industry down here
and I don't really get out a lot to, because my job, to, to exercise.
Well, I, uh, am an assistant teacher and, uh, in business technology
and I've, I think the most exercise I've gotten in the last three to four month is jumping up and down to go answer the kids' questions.
It keeps me pretty busy,
but it's not really the kind of exercise that gets your heart rate going.
Right.
And, uh, you know, it really,
exercise is so important.
It is.
And I realize that.
That's, that's the way I feel.
I'm used to being in pretty good shape because when I was in high school I stayed in pretty good shape, played a little basketball and stuff like that,
but I've got,
now, I'm in college
and I go to school during the day and work at night.
I can tell that I've not really done a whole lot.
When you, uh, exercise, what do you do?
Do you do it at home or a club
or,
Well, uh, I usually, I usually play at home.
We live out in the country
so me and my brother play basketball and have a bunch of guys come over and play
or a lot of times we're, we're up at the church
we'll play volleyball
stuff like that.
I got a hold of, uh, Richard Simmons' tape, uh
Oh, really?
what is it, uh,
I can't even think of the name of it right offhand, with the oldies.
Oh, the SWEATING TO THE OLDIES?
Sweating with the, to the oldies, *title
yeah
and that's not bad.
Oh, really?
That's pretty upbeat,
so, you know, I, every once in a while I'll put the cassette in and go with it.
Right.
Not often enough to have a routine
Right.
I'll,
My little Schnauzer wishes I would get out and walk with her.
Oh, really?
But, uh, I don't know,
by the time I get home, all I want to do is just collapse or sit down at my computer
and my fingers exercise more than anything now.
Right,
that's the way I am.
I just want to sit down and relax.
Too tired to exercise. *slash error I did.
Yes.
Uh, do you ever ride a bike or anything like that?
I started riding my bike about a couple of months ago
and I'd ride about two or three miles a day,
but, but it would last about a couple of weeks
and it got real cold for a little while
so I gave it up.
Here, about the, the most common exercise for people is to go to the malls and walk, uh,
Walk around.
Because they're enclosed
and no matter what the weather is they can walk at a pretty good clip and, and not have to worry about the weather summer or winter.
Right.
Right,
I've noticed people doing that down here, too.
I'll be in town or something
and people will walk around the mall.
And it's safe.
It, it is fairly safe.
That's, uh, you know, inside the mall
may be not safe going to the parking garage
Yeah,
certain parts of it.
I know a doctor once told me it, it,
a friend of mine, uh, suggested swimming as being the best exercise there is.
Right.
Right,
I used to do a lot of swimming,
we have, we have a swimming pool,
but it's an old concrete pool.
We've been having trouble with it the past few years,
so we haven't got to use it much,
but I love to swim and water ski and stuff like that.
The, uh, swimming, they say, uses more muscles than any other exercise with,
and the water takes the resistance.
Right.
Right,
and you don't get the soreness.
I've, I've done some water exercises,
but our pool is not, is not heated
so it's,
Right,
you can't do it year round.
Summertime only.
Right,
that's the way ours is.
You don't go out when it's twenty some odd degrees, go out to the swimming pool.
Oh, no,
it's too cold.
Hot tubs are not, uh, not too bad,
but
I could deal with a hot tub.
Those are nice.
So, what part of Mississippi are you from?
I'm from Laurel.
Whereabouts is that?
That's way down towards the south.
Not quite on the coast,
but we're about two hours from the coast.
Oh,
and you do have cold weather down there?
Yes, ma'am,
it, it started about yesterday, I believe.
It started raining and got real cold.
Ours started Thanksgiving.
Oh.
And, uh, from there just, well,
today was pretty,
but, uh, oh, Sunday the snow and ice came in.
Right.
And, uh, there was no exercise.
