I really haven't seen any movies lately,
so when the computer picked this one, I was a little bit surprised,
but, I think I haven't been to the movie theater here in about, oh, six months,
but, uh, you know, the last movies that I've seen were probably on video.
Oh, well that's,
we rent a lot of videos too.
Yeah
Uh, we saw,
I have two little babies
and we saw one movie recently
and that was THE TERMINATOR movie, uh, which I didn't like after all .
Uh-huh.
Yeah,
now I I haven't seen THE TERMINATOR movie,
but, and that's kind of blood and guts, isn't it.
I don't particularly care for that sort of stuff.
Well, I don't either.
It,
on all the, the advertisements Arnold Schwarzenegger says he doesn't kill anybody in the movie.
He doesn't.
He maims them
Yeah,
right.
So,
Yeah,
he maims them pretty good, doesn't he?
Uh-huh.
He, he, uh, I think he shoots off their knee caps for the most part. In the movie.
Yeah.
Uh-huh.
So.
I, I saw, uh, SLEEPING WITH THE ENEMY.
Uh, Uh, I saw it, uh,
Oh, I haven't seen that one yet.
oh, couple weeks ago I rented it and, uh, watched it
and I was, I was pretty disappointed in it
because I, I was told by several people that it's pretty scary and intense
Uh-huh.
and I was pretty disappointed in it.
Oh.
Now it's a good movie,
but, I guess that they built me up too much. For my expectations in it there.
Yeah,
well, With all the commercials and everything.
Uh-huh.
I haven't,
that's one we want to see.
I, I want to see, uh, DANCES WITH WOLVES.
Uh-huh.
But, we haven't seen that one yet, either.
Yeah.
Now I haven't seen it either,
but, uh, I've heard that it's real long. That it's a good movie, but it's long, like three hours.
Yeah,
that's what I heard, too.
Yeah,
we've got to get it at a time when we can put our kids to bed and stay up late to watch it We saw, uh, the, the, uh, movie with, uh, Sylvester Stallone, OSCAR.
That's right.
That's right.
OSCAR.
Supposed to be his, uh, his debut in comedy.
Uh-huh.
Which was an interesting movie, but not very funny.
Yeah.
I know my daughter saw that
and she liked it
so,
Did she?
Yeah
Well, it was, it was an amusing movie.
Uh-huh.
It
I guess maybe it would have been better if we'd have been at the theater as opposed to, uh, just at the house watching it with, with no one else around.
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
So,
And, of course, I get to watch all these movies like LOOK WHO'S TALKING and WHO'S, LOOK WHO'S TALKING, TOO
and, because I have a ten year old
so, We, we watch a lot of movies around that category, you know that she, that she can watch
Oh.
Uh-huh.
My son just turned two
and so THE LITTLE MERMAID is now our favorite movie.
Yeah.
We seen THE LITTLE MERMAID, too.
LITTLE MERMAID and PETER PAN I think are, are his two favorites that we've got
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
And there's some, I think there's some good Disney movies fixing to come out on video, uh, SHIPWRECKED.
Oh, I haven't, I didn't hear that was coming out.
Uh-huh.
Yeah,
it's fixing to come out on video
and, boy, I can't think of the other one that's fixing to come out.
Well, they just had uh, THE RESCUERS movie
But,
Uh-huh.
that was a Disney movie, wasn't it.
I think I heard that was just one, was just out.
He's, uh, he doesn't sit still for the whole movie, yet,
but he likes to, uh, to listen to the music and stuff if there's a lot of that in the in the movie.
Right.
Uh-huh.
Well, I'm glad to know that there's somebody else out there that doesn't get to go to the movie theater
Well, I tell you, ever
my, my kids are just small babies
and, I tell you, we really want to go a lot
Yeah.
and, uh, there's so much out on video now, that it's almost, you know,
the movie comes out quicker than you can go see it. Sometimes.
Uh-huh. And then they go to the dollar movies.
So.
Uh-huh
That seems to happen.
I noticed that DANCES WITH WOLVES was playing at the, uh, Granada Theater.
Uh-huh.
And, uh, someone said that was a lot of fun to go do.
You can have dinner and everything while you watch the movie.
I thought that might be kind of fun to do.
Yeah,
that does sound fun.
And, of course, you need a baby-sitter for that
Definitely.
But, uh, no,
I'd really like to get out to the movies more often.
Course, it's so expensive, now, too that you can't hardly afford it.
Right.
I, I know we get discount tickets where my husband works,
Uh-huh.
but, other than that it just seems like it's so expensive.
And then the popcorn and everything else,
you almost can't afford to do it. No matter what.
That's right.
Although we did actually get,
we went on vacation couple months ago,
and we got to go see WHAT ABOUT BOB?
Uh-huh.
That was kind of a funny movie with, uh, Richard Dreyfuss and Bill Murray.
Uh-huh.
That was fun.
Golly,
I don't think that I've ever heard of that movie.
Oh, he's a, Richard Dreyfuss is a, uh, psychiatrist
and Bob is his patient
and Bob follows him on vacation.
It's, uh,
Oh, that's the, that's the one where they burn down the house or something
Uh-huh,
uh-huh
the house explodes?
Uh-huh.
Oh, okay.
Yeah,
that's the one.
Okay,
yeah.
Another movie that I want to see if it ever comes out on video so I can see it without my daughter around is, uh, oh,
I just forgot the title of it.
Uh Oh, it's supposed to be a real scary one
Uh, darn,
well, here, here's another one that I've seen.
I saw, uh,
I can't remember the title of it, either
Must have left an impression.
