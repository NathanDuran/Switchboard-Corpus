Okay.
Why don't you go ahead and start.
Okay,
well, we subscribe to PEOPLE magazine and to TIME,
and, of course I like the PEOPLE magazine because it's gossipy and it's fast reading,
Uh-huh.
and, uh, the TIME of course, is, uh, you know, more newsworthy
and, uh, it has more world affair type things, of course.
And then I will purchase a GOOD HOUSEKEEPING occasionally, especially around the holiday time because of recipes and ideas and and things like that
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
and, uh, do you subscribe to any magazines?
Yeah,
I, well, I have, in a for a while I haven't gotten any because I just find that I'm not reading what I'm getting because, uh, I have so much going on in my life
that seems to be the last thing I pick up,
so I found that I was wasting my money. As much as I enjoy them, uh, when I do subscribe
I, I've gotten in the past the PARENTS magazine and, uh, the HOUSEKEEPING magazine
Uh-huh
uh.
you probably have smaller children younger children.
Yes,
yeah,
My children, our children are grown
Yeah,
yeah,
and, uh, I'm letting their mother read on the grandchildren
Right,
well, I found that after a couple of years of having a PARENTS magazine it was getting repetitious,
so I kind of canceled it anyway for that reason.
Uh, the HOUSEKEEPING magazines I do like because they, like you say, they have nice, uh, recipes in them and ideas, but, uh, lately they've just been piling up on me,
so I figured it wasn't, uh, something I needed at this point in time.
Well, do you think that people subscribe to magazines as much as they used to?
I don't know,
I, I, well,
my husband would love to have more.
Now he's the type who will get the, uh, INC. magazine and MONEY magazine and all the financial type magazines,
Yes,
now my husband does that,
and
Yeah,
you know, and of course, uh, naturally WALL STREET JOURNAL, you know and, or SPORTS ILLUSTRATED,
Uh-huh,
but I don't know,
I know a few people leafing through them at the store
but you just don't hear people talk about them,
and I know years ago, when, uh, my children were young and stuff, I just loved LADIES HOME JOURNAL, McCALL'S, GOOD HOUSEKEEPING,
and I took them all
Uh-huh.
and, uh, then, oh, I don't know what
in the seventies, maybe, late seventies they changed their format
Uh-huh.
and I haven't,
I don't think there's been a magazine as they used to be
Well
even GOOD HOUSEKEEPING I don't,
yeah,
and some of those have had what, what I consider or what
I get the idea that they are maybe the, the more pricier type magazines, as far as women's magazines.
They seem just to be so chocked full of, of ads.
Oh, they are.
My sister, uh, takes, uh, TOWN AND COUNTRY and VOGUE
Uh-huh.
and she sends them to me,
and there's really nothing in them but advertisements for very expensive clothes, very expensive jewelry things that the average middle class citizen is not going to be purchasing
Yeah,
yeah,
Yes.
Right
you know, and if I want to drool or if I want to see how the other half is living you know, then I can, I look through them
Yes.
Yeah.
and I do,
I just,
what I do is I flip through them and, and pitch them then, you know,
they're not something I, you know, take any length of time over.
Uh-huh,
uh-huh.
I have discovered that, you know, with my available time, I would rather actually read a book than a magazine.
Yes
I enjoy books a lot more
Yes
that's true.
and, uh.
Well
So, but.
now I have certainly stopped subscribing as much as I used to,
other than my children have gotten.
You know, they get tons of magazines it seems
Yes
they're always getting something in the mail
and, and, uh, so between reading to them and, uh, reading the newspaper,
and then I have a book that I'm occasionally reading when I get a chance,
but I just don't get a chance for those, uh, newsy magazines, the ones that are full of ads,
unless you just want to skim through while you're,
I, I read them when I'm at a doctor's office or, you know, waiting on something like that.
Yes,
yes,
I will read them in a doctor's office, too.
Yeah,
As I said, I, I subscribe to, uh, to PEOPLE and to TIME,
and, uh, and I will go through the TIME, but, usually not cover to cover, you know,
I'll glance through it.
I like reading, uh, you know, the PASSAGE OF PEOPLE or something you know,
Uh-huh,
uh-huh.
and, uh, but I do like the PEOPLE magazine.
It, it reminds me of the old time movie magazines when I was young
Oh, uh-huh.
and, uh, that's one, and you know, I really like that,
I enjoy that.
It's quick reading you know,
Uh-huh.
it doesn't require a lot of thinking,
and sometimes after I've worked all day and have things to do at night, I just, I want fluff
Yeah.
Uh-huh,
uh-huh.
I don't want a lot of thinking
That's true,
that kind of is a good way to do it.
It, uh, you know, it's, it's much more relaxing.
Sometimes when I read TIME magazine, after I've read an article I'm real depressed over the situation of the world
so. Well, it seems like we both kind of agree on the subject of magazines
Yeah,
yeah.
and, uh
Okay.
so, uh, I think that probably I will end the call.
I've enjoyed,
