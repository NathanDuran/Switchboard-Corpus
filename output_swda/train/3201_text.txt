So do you have any recycling programs there?
Um, I don't really think we have anything in the works as of yet.
Uh-huh.
Uh, we're a pretty small town
and, uh, the closest thing we have are bins like out in front of Wal-Mart that show, you know, plastics, paper liter bottles, et cetera, et cetera.
Oh, uh-huh.
Yeah.
We've progressed a little bit farther than that.
Yeah.
Um, actually they have, uh,
parts of town,
it may have even spread all over the whole town,
and, um, they will have these green bins
Uh-huh.
and it's just as standard as a, a regular trash can that they come by and pick up and dump.
Yeah.
And, uh, just along with a trash can you have this, this green plastic bin,
and you put your bottles in it and paper and, uh, you know, all those things that
aluminum.
You know, anything that can be recycled you just put in that bin.
Oh.
And, uh, I guess you can
and a lot of the restaurants they just have, uh, places where you can throw away, especially beer places, where you can throw away green bottles, and then the brown bottles.
Yeah.
Huh.
And, uh, oh, I don't know,
I guess they're, you know, clear bottles.
Yeah.
So, um, you know a lot of people do have those separated.
And, of course, they have the, um, dumpsters, uh, the, the igloos.
Yeah.
Uh, and they have those strategically placed around the city.
Oh.
And, uh, they're, they're actually going to extend it, I think, one of these days maybe to apartment complexes
and, uh,
Oh, that would be good.
Yeah,
things of that nature.
So, I guess when you live in a bigger city it, it really becomes, uh, necessary.
Yeah,
see, it's not anywhere near that.
Uh, we, you know,
as far as our little pitch in to it we do recycle our aluminum cans.
Oh, yeah.
But that's as far as we go
because I take them to a girl at work,
and she goes and cashes them in because, you know,
I just I can do that for her
Uh-huh.
and and I don't want the hassle because we have to go to another town to do it.
Yeah.
Oh, really?
Yeah,
Huh.
see we don't have anything here in Belton.
It's, it's a pretty small little town.
Yeah,
I remember my grandparents and I used to always get out there on the road and pick up beer cans.
Yeah.
And, uh,
So, you know, that's about all the, that we're doing here.
Uh, they're, uh, getting a little bit more on,
they need to a lot a more community awareness of just what is it mean to recycle, and what can you recycle and what you can't. Because, you know, not a lot of people do really know what, you know, what it's for.
Uh-huh.
Yeah,
they're doing a real good job of, uh, separating it here.
And, of course, there you know you have a specific place to put your paper.
Yeah.
And, uh, they try to get you to go ahead and separate it,
but they actually have the door to door pickup.
Um, and it's, uh, I think it started out to be, um, just kind of a test, a pilot project.
Uh-huh.
And it went over so well that they just extended it.
And it's almost, uh,
I don't know if it's done by a private company or not.
It may be.
But, uh, they just go around to each, uh, door and pick it up.
Wow, that's excellent.
Yeah.
That's good.
Let's see.
Oh, and every year, of course, the phone books um, they tell everybody across the city to, uh, put all their phone books in, uh, the, uh, recycle bins.
Yeah.
Oh.
Because, you know, phone books are pretty,
well, for a bigger city they're pretty thick.
Yeah,
they are .
And sometimes you might have two or three.
Exactly.
So, uh, that's, that's a big savings right there in itself.
Yeah,
see ours just goes in the regular trash.
Yeah,
It just, you know, there's not a whole lot.
huh.
And there are, you know, some places that will set up you know for old newspapers and stuff.
Uh-huh.
But usually it's, it, it hasn't caught on yet.
I'm hoping it will soon.
Uh-huh.
Well, the thing about newspapers and paper,
recycled paper is actually very expensive.
Yeah.
So, when you see something that's on recycled paper, they've actually gone to a lot of expense to do that.
It's, uh,
they're not coming out ahead at all.
It's, uh, it's really a cost.
Huh. I wasn't totally aware of that.
Yeah.
So.
I mean it, it sounds good to the public
but there's really a big cost incurred when you do recycle something.
Now, aluminum I don't know.
They may be coming out ahead.
But I know, for a fact that the paper, uh, on that end they're not, you know.
Yeah.
It's just good to recycle
but it's, uh, not to their advantage.
Yeah.
And it costs less.
Huh. Well,
I can't think of anything else.
I can't either. Because we're, we're at a very, you know, beginning stages,
Okay.
so.
Uh-huh.
We look forward to it to get better .
Well, I hope you all, um, uh, come along a little farther in the future.
Yeah,
me too.
It was nice talking to you.
You too.
Bye-bye.
Bye.
