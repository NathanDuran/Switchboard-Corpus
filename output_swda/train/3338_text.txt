Tell me what you like to do.
Well, I, I collect antique tools, uh, for one thing, I well, I'm sort of in an antique business,
but it's a little sideline, part time thing.
Oh.
Uh-huh,
wonderful.
And, uh, I'm building a, a log house at a farm that I have in East Texas, which is a hundred miles from here.
Oh.
Wonderful.
Yeah,
it's really neat.
And, uh, uh, course I've been working on it for five years,
but, you know,
Oh, but how wonderful.
Are you close to getting it done?
Yeah,
yeah,
it's getting real close to
Oh.
you know, of course there's still a lot of work to be done,
and then when you get it completely, you know, the shell finished, uh, you still have a lot of stuff to do inside,
but, uh,
Are you going to move your whole family over there then?
No,
actually, uh, I'm not even sure,
I may,
I'll probably always have a place here in Richardson or Dallas
Uh-huh,
kind of your getaway place.
Yeah,
escape.
But it's beautiful,
it's, you know, it's Eastern Hardwood, uh, forest,
there are a lot of pine trees,
but it's mostly oaks
and .
Oh, how beautiful,
and it's pretty flat there?
Well, it's kind of, hilly,
but, it's, you know, low hills,
it's not, uh,
See, I've only been to Texas once.
I have two sisters in Texas now, um, one in Austin, one in Dallas,
and the one in Dallas is the one that got me to doing this
Yeah.
and, uh, I thought Austin was beautiful
You,
I liked the hills and the trees,
Yeah,
in
Yeah,
it's really different because that's kind of the, you know, that's the chalk hills down there,  limestone hills,
Oh, and you've always,  lived in Texas, have you?
Yeah,
except for time in service.
Uh-huh.
Born and raised Texan, huh.
Yeah. At, at which one?
Well, I had never been there,

Uh. University of Texas in Dallas.
Oh, okay
Yeah.
it's just north of me here.
Yeah,
well that's, he's got a job there
and this is his first year,
so, it's been a real interesting thing for them
That's great.
But they seem to like it okay.
I think they're too far away from me,
but maybe some day they can get closer,
Well, yeah,
we'll see.
Pretty good trip.
So what do you, what kind of hobbies are you in?
Well, I'm mother of four,
so basically I'm just, real busy with my kids right now in sports,
and we have a little Halloween talent show tonight,
and, I substitute at the schools part-time.
Oh, that's great.
Well, I am a travel agent at heart,
and my hobby is just,
I love traveling and, and being involved of that and finding out more, uh,
but, it's real hard to work in the summers and holidays and weekends when you have four children and a husband,
so I reluctantly gave that career up and am just substituting at the school,
No, kidding.
so I've been librarian all this week, which has been real interesting,
and I'm enjoying it.
I'm around my kids
That's pretty easy substituting isn't it?
