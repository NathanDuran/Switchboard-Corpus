Okay,
all set.
Good morning
Good morning.
Let's see,
music, um,
well, I play a couple of instruments.
Uh-huh.
I try to.
What do you play?
Um, clarinet is my primary instrument,
and I also play a little bit of saxophone, flute and piano when I get the opportunity, which isn't very often.
Uh-huh.
Really,
that's too bad
How about yourself?
I play, uh, the violin and play trumpet
Uh-huh.
Uh.
and I run a municipal band
and I sometimes conduct.
Oh, wow.
So, I'm pretty busy too.
I play in three different symphony orchestras.
Wow.
We have a nice big one here in State College, called the Nitny Valley Symphony.
That's great.
Uh-huh.
I play in the Altoona Symphony,
was about forty-five miles away
Uh-huh.
and I play in a slightly smaller one called the Lockhaven Symphony and Community Orchestra.
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
So are you a professional musician?
No,
I'm, uh, just retiring from Penn State University
Uh-huh.
only I, I should, should have been.
I spend about half my time playing music or preparing for it somewhere.
Uh-huh.
But, uh, I've been working at, uh, Penn State and using up all my nighttimes, and weekends uh, going to these orchestra rehearsals and, and concerts and so forth.
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh,
I understand,
yeah.
I'm in one community band here,
and that's just,
well, we rehearse once a week.
We generally have a concert every other week
and,
You have one that often.
Yeah
That's amazing because I, I, I have it set up here that we have at least six to seven rehearsals per concert.
That's a lot.
No,
we sure don't.
Wow.
Well, one thing is, we have a summer summer series,
and every single Sunday night we play at the library to have a little out, outdoor stage set up
Uh-huh.
Oh.
and so we do that every Sunday night during the summer,
You are busy.
yeah,
and then, I don't know. We just have an awful lot of engagements,
and we're just having to turn a lot of people down, um, because, you know, uh, we don't want to do things like have a concert back to back or even two days in a row.
Where do you get all this music,
I mean, you, you must back up and play some of the music twice.
Oh yes,
definitely, we really do.
You know, you get your little Sousa book
and you just flip through it, and that sort of thing.
Oh, okay.
So your, you don't play pretty well a full concert band music most of the time then.
It really depends on who shows up.
Uh-huh.
Um, and it's always a mystery,
because it actually doesn't matter who shows up,
it matters what instruments they brought,
because so many people switch instruments so often.
Right.
Uh-huh.
But, um, yeah,
in the winter we do more concert stuff
and,
How many people in your band?
Um, I think there's about seventy.
Seventy.
Yeah,
there's a lot.
Holy mackerel,
that's.
But, on any given night there's not seventy you know,
Uh-huh.
it alternates quite a lot.
Boy,
that is a huge organization,
that's great.
Yeah,
it really is.
Because about the best I can normally hope for is about fifty in, in the band I have here.
Oh.
Yeah,
well.
But that fills a stage and keeps us busy,
but they were, half have been professionals from, uh, a lot of them are from, uh, faculty at Penn State here.
Oh, okay.
And so they want to play things that, uh, push them to do.
So that's why we have to work real hard when we get a concert together.
Uh-huh.
We have about four concerts per year indoors and two or three that we play outside.
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
And the last one we did was in a large, uh, mall close here,
we played Christmas about an hour out in this mall.
Uh-huh,
uh-huh.
So that worked out very nicely.
Yeah,
that's fun.
Yeah.
Well, let's see.
Well, there's another band around here.
Someone at work is trying to get me to join that one, because they need clarinet players
Uh-huh.
and their concert schedule isn't as heavy,
but they have more in the summer,
I think they have ten in the summer, you know, one, one week after the other.
I think they're like Monday nights and they don't have rehearsals during that time period.
Wow,
that.
Are you just saying you, you sight read every concert?
Uh, well, it's not really sight reading when you've done it, you know, again and again and again,
but some people are,
Okay.
yeah
Uh-huh.
some of them are.
And where, where does this happen, Laurie,
is this in Dallas?
Well, they're in the suburbs of Dallas, in Richardson and Plano.
Uh-huh.
We're real close to Dallas.
Well, I declare.
Yeah.
That's amazing.
Yeah,
well, it's more of a, I think it's very much more of a social group than anything else, you know.
Okay.
And, and people always bring refreshments for after rehearsal and hang around for an hour or so
Okay.
and, That's probably why we get so many people.
Uh-huh.
Do any of your, you, in your group get paid for any of this?
Um, well, the conductor gets paid a little bit, you know,
we do get some money from the city because we do play at a lot of city events.
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
Um, I think he's the only one that gets paid.
Uh-huh.
And you do have to buy your music.
Who, who sponsors you basically, the city?
The city,
uh-huh.
Yeah, uh,
my band is sponsored through what they call Parks and Recreation.
Yeah,
it's a similar thing.
Yeah.
I can't remember what they call it,
but the same type of thing.
Uh-huh.
Um, but we do get an awful lot of music, you know,
we can borrow music from any of the area colleges
Yes.
or, you know, if some, some group just isn't going to play any more, they'll just give us their music, and that type of thing.
Uh-huh.
And we do an awful lot of, you know,
we don't charge for any of our performances,
but we get a lot of donations.
Well, I, I work the same way
Yeah
Well, I'll be darned.
It's amazing.
