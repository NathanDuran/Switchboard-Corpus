All right, this is easy for me since I,
And me too, because I eat out a lot.
Yeah,
well I travel,
I do about forty percent of my time is on the road.
So you eat all your meals out.
I eat a lot of meals out,
well I'm also married
and my wife is an A one cook,
but she enjoys eating out,
so I have to share it with her.
And, uh, actually it's very easy for me, because I, I have a make it a practice when I am out,
I eat differently than what I could eat at home or around here.
Sure.
So, I look for just about anything,
and it's, it's, uh, it's a lot of fun.
I don't have to worry, really worry too much about price considerations because I, you know,
I was going to ask you, could you go to, you know, nice places,
and,
Oh, sure,
yeah,
and it's, it's really great.
I, I, I like different types of food.
So where are your, what are the places, you know, memorable places you've eaten?
Uh, oh you okay you name it.
Let's see,
you've got one down in, uh, down near, uh, Addison,
uh, there's two restaurants that I particularly like that I, every time I get into Texas or I get into Atlanta, Georgia, I make sure I go,
and that's Houston's.
Oh, Houston's,
uh-huh.
Yep,
okay.
It's a great place.
It's, it's great.
There's a, a restaurant in, um, right outside of Reading, Pennsylvania, it's called Alfredo's that does not look like a restaurant that you would really want to recommend to a lot of people.
Uh-huh.
But it is fantastic.
Uh, there's a restaurant, and I don't recall the name of it, uh, in, uh, Panama City.
Of course, not too many people want to rush back to Panama City, uh, Panama, the country, uh, Panama.
Oh, okay,
because I was thinking,
well, I, I grew up in Panama City.
No
this is the country this is the country Panama, all right?
I get it.
Right.
And, uh, but I have gotten to quite a few.
And I go to Canada and get quite a few restaurants up there.
I, you know, and I know the locations,
and I know the places,
but I, lot of times I don't remember the names.
I'd have to go back through some expense reports.
Uh-huh.
But particularly, down in your area, I'm looking for some, some more restaurants.
So, I, you know, I don't know what's, what's down there,  the ones out in Addison.
Do you like Mexican?
Do you like Mexican food.
Not particularly
Oh.
that's one of the few,
why, which one were you going to recommend?
Well, I mean, there's so many places here, you know,
there's just, it's just lots of good Mexican restaurants here.
Uh-huh.
But in the Addison, well about everything that you could want in Dallas is in the Addison area, anyway.
Right.
I mean, now there's a new Italian place Sfuzi
Okay,
I have a,
that has a great, I've not been there, but it has a great reputation as one of the best restaurants in Dallas,
and now there's one in Addison.
Okay,
let,
I'm, I'm writing it down
It's F, S it's S F U Z I.
Okay.
And it's on, it's in Addison,
and it's a great place.
Also a great place that they have like Cajun food is Copelands.
I've been there.
Now I really like Copelands.
Okay,
I've been there.
Um, one down there is the, uh, I think it's an old schoolhouse.
Oh, the, yeah, the, I know,
no,
I don't like that place.
Well, I like the food,
but I don't care for the clowning around.
See, uh, uh,
yeah,
I, I, when I went, I thought the food was not good.
Oh, really?
Oh I've had,
Magic Time Machine is the place you're thinking of,
That's it,
that's it.
I've had excellent food there.
See, I, when I went, I thought,
the people drove me crazy first of all
True.
True.
but then I just thought the food was over priced for what it was.
Uh-huh.
Yeah,
all right,
well, that's great.
Uh, no,
Italian is fine.
I make it a habit of always going out to Pasta Oggi's which is right down there in
Do you like, like Southwestern?
Oh, yeah.
Well, now there's a good place in Addison too called Blue Mesa Grill that's on Belt Line that's close to Houston's, as a matter of fact.
All right.
Really?
And, um, it's great,
I mean, their, they have, I think,
sometimes I've been when I thought, Well, it wasn't as good,
but I went there recently,
and I thought, Well, this really is good.
Uh-huh.
So that's, that's a very good place to eat, The Blue Mesa Grill.
Good.
And, um,
Well, this is great.
This is going to give me  some more places to go.
A whole new,  dining experience.
Okay,
fine.
I guess our time's about up,
so.
Well, they haven't beeped us, have they?
Uh, well, they don't always.
Oh, I thought sometimes they say, you know this is three minutes or whatever.
Yeah,
I they've been doing that when, uh, the circuits are busy
Oh, okay.
and other than that, they, you know, leave you go about five minutes,
and then, that, that's about it.
I guess that's what they need for their machines to get everything down pat,
so.
Okay,
It was a pleasure talking to you.
Well, thanks for calling for helping us out.
Okay.
You bet,
Bye-bye.
Bye-bye.
