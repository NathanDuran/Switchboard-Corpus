Well, what kind of vacations do you like to take? .
Well, we've, uh, we've been fortunate enough to take a couple of trips over to Europe
so So, I, I guess those are the types I like
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
We've really enjoyed them.
Yeah.
Where have you gone there?
We've gone to, um, Germany, Switzerland, Austria, Ireland and England.
Uh-huh.
We've been to Germany twice.
Uh-huh.
But, um, I guess my favorite is probably Switzerland and Ireland.
Uh-huh.
Yeah
well, I've been over there too.
Uh-huh.
Where have you been?
I even.
Let's see, um,
mostly Germany and France.
Uh-huh.
I lived in France for a year and a half
so I was able,
Oh, how neat.
but, I, once when I had a chance in France to go on vacation instead of travelling around France I went to Germany
Uh-huh.
because, uh, I've got relatives there
and I just  like it there.
Oh,  that's neat.
Uh-huh.
So, but, um, Austria, I found really pretty and Switzerland,
Uh-huh.
yeah,
and I, I lived in the Alps in France
so I anything in the mountains over there I just love.
Oh, how neat.
Oh, yeah.
Then I finally made it to England, too, uh, on my way home, um,
I lived in Africa, actually,
and on my way  home from there.
You lived in Africa?
Yeah.
Oh, my goodness
Yeah.
Wow.
So, um, and you always have to go out, fly through, or unless you fly from Nairobi, you have to fly through, um, uh, Europe on your way home.
Uh-huh.
So, I went to England,
and I really liked it there too.
It's so expensive over there
I know,
it's true.
That's the one thing.
It really is.
It just, it's, it's,
I love to go over there,
but it's so darn expensive to go over.
Yeah.
Yeah,
actually now you can get some really good deals flying over,
but it's
Yeah.
once you're there you still have to spend money Unless you know people, you know
Oh, I know,
just.
Right.
Then you can stay with them,
and  yeah.
Uh-huh.
That helps  a lot.
Yeah.
But.
You know there's a lot of places in the states that we haven't even gone.
Uh-huh.
You know, I'd like to go to Hawaii some time,
and and, uh, we made it,
Yeah.
we've, we've at least gone to the Grand Canyon and Niagara Falls.
So.
Uh-huh.
Yeah.
Feel like  we've accomplished a little bit here.
I haven't.
I've been, I've,
most of my vacationing in the U S has been on the West Coast
Uh-huh.
or this summer I went to Colorado
Uh-huh.
and, uh, I'd love to go to the East Coast,  during the Fall.
The, oh, the
it's, oh,
I've always wanted to go there.
I've seen pictures,
and, and it looks gorgeous.
Yeah.
We, um, we made a trip up the East Coast.
It was, uh, in the summer
Uh-huh.
and it really is pretty.
Uh-huh.
It's, uh,
both coasts are really pretty
Yeah.
but, um, I love the Carolinas.
It's just gorgeous over there.
Uh-huh.
I haven't been there, anywhere on the East Coast.
Yeah.
I think Tennessee has been the furthest east I've been.
Uh-huh.
Yeah.
Well, you'll just have to plan a vacation some time and, and go over there.
Yeah,
I guess so.
Yeah,
but there's, you know, there's a lot to see here
Uh-huh.
but I just love going over to Europe because it's so, their way of life is just so different than ours.
Yeah.
You know, we're so fast paced here,
and over there, you know, every time we'd go and, and eat dinner or lunch or whatever we'd always have to ask for the check you know
Uh-huh.
Yeah.
they're so leisurely over there
Yeah.
and it's kind of nice to, to have that.
Yeah.
So the type of vacation you'd like, um,
like, would you go over and spend a lot of time in one place, or travel to whole bunch of different places in one week?
Well, usually a bunch of different places.
Yeah,
mainly probably because you want to see everything.
Right,
see as much as you can while you're there.
Yeah.
Yeah,
I know.
Yeah.
Yeah.
How did you like Africa?
Well, I liked it.
I was working in Cameroon, Africa
Uh-huh.
and it's not a, it's not a place for tourists,
I mean, they're not used to having tourists there,
so it's,
Uh-huh.
you're kind of roughing it.
But, um, I liked it,
I liked it.
Uh-huh.
The people there are just very, very friendly
and.
What type of work?
Um, I was working with an organization that does Bible translation.
Oh, okay.
So I was doing linguistic work actually, travelling around, finding out about languages, and uh, what they call survey work.
Oh, uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
Find out where the languages are.
Uh-huh.
So, I travelled a lot around the country and met a lot of people.
Yeah.
Um.
That's neat.
Yeah,
I enjoyed it.
So.
I've, I've always, um, I've talked to people who have been to Africa,
and they,
and then of course when that movie OUT OF AFRICA came out
Yeah.
Um, but I've always thought it would be neat to go on a safari over there.
Yeah,
my cousin came over while I was there,
and she came to Cameroon
and then she went over to Nairobi and took a safari around you know, close to Nairobi  in Kenya.
Uh-huh.
Oh how  neat.
So, she'd always dreamed of doing that too.
Yeah,
that's  great.
So.  Yeah.
So is there any place you would try to talk me into going to
Uh.
It sounds like we've been to some of the same places.
Yeah,
it does.
