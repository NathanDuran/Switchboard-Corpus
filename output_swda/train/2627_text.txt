Okay,
so do you do a lot of cooking in your family?
Um, I do some every now and then,
I, I work
and my wife's home during the day
so she usually ends up doing most of it.
Oh, yeah.
When I was single we used to always cook, around the house.
Yeah,
do, do you like to cook.
Huh, yeah,
I really like it,
Yeah,
yeah.
um, there's  a few dishes,
like, I, I grew up with the, um, you know, having Polish and Ukrainian food.
Oh, really.
And my wife, she likes Italian and stuff,
Oh.
so  we, we definitely have different tastes,
so.
Yeah,
yeah,
but that's neat though, because you get to have different stuff
Uh-huh.
Yeah,
I'm not, I'm a pretty bad cook
I'm pretty bad.
My husband is really good,
he put himself through college working in restaurants.
Oh, wow.
And, uh, he's much better cook than I am,
so, when I was home I still cooked a lot
and I was in to a lot of vegetarian stuff.
And now, I went back to work about a year and a half ago
so, one of the things that he took over was the cooking
and the kids are thrilled,
they're really happy, that I don't cook anymore.
Uh, they're like, uh, preferring it now, right
Yeah,
they say oh dad, let dad cook mom,
let him do it
But, um, so, so do you all, do you have kids?
You obviously have one.
Yeah,
two,
uh-huh.
Okay,
you have two.
Yeah,
one is, uh, nine months
and the other is two and a half.
Two and half, oh.
Yeah,
that's the hard part is cooking with, uh, kids around because, uh,
I was just going to say, makes a difference in what you eat doesn't it
Or are you not at that stage yet?
Yeah,
it does
Yeah.
We try our hardest to get them to eat what we, eat, you know.
Right.
And my sister, uh, she's the master of the fast order grill, you know,
Oh, yeah.
she can  make, uh, she makes six different meals,
but.
Oh my gosh.
Like to have  one thing, you know,
one likes chicken nuggets, the other one like hot dogs,
Oh my gosh,
I couldn't
and then she makes noodles with,  uh, with,   soy sauce or whatever,
Yeah.
so, all things.
Boy, I couldn't do that,
I
But, um, yeah,
our favorite,
let me think,
I was thinking of the one recipe that, uh, that we made.
I guess the thing that always turned out the best for us was something we thought looked really fancy but was real easy,
and that was, um,  uh, scallops,  uh, scallop, um,
What's that.
Oh really.
it has  a French name,
it basically means that it has a Swiss cheese, cream sauce with it
and you pour it over rice,
Oh yeah,
what's, what is that, Saint Jack or something.
Yeah, uh.
Scallops Saint  something,
or, yeah, .
Yeah,
I can't even remember what the recipe's name is anymore,
Yeah,
yeah.
but, uh,  it was basically just ground up Swiss cheese and then, uh, standard cream sauce base and then, uh the scallops.
Really,
with scallops.
An, and it sounds sort of funny
but it tastes really good.
No,
no,
I'm from New England,
so we, we had, um, a lot of seafood before we moved down here.
And, uh, that sounds delicious to me.
Yeah.
That sounds great.
Yeah,
but, uh,
I think, we're just thinking of having, a, uh, dinner party.
We went to this dinner party the other night that was kind of like a game,
they had, uh, a murder mystery,
Uh-huh.
and  you came dressed as one of the characters
and you had to solve the mystery during the dinner,
Uh-huh.
and  it was really fun
and so we, we were thinking we wanted to do, you know, we were going to try doing it ourselves,
but we're trying to decide what can we serve because at this one the hostess was pretty busy running around trying to get stuff ready for the table
and that kind of interrupted the game,
so,  so I  was thinking there's this Beef Bourguignonne recipe that I've tried before that's pretty good
Right,
yeah.
and then you can make that ahead
and you can just leave it in the pot on a stove until you're ready.
Uh-huh.
So that's, uh,
Yeah
that's another thing
I have a problem with my wife,
Yeah.
she,  uh, she likes to, um, she doesn't like the beef dishes.
She likes the chicken and fish,
Uh, yeah.
and, like  I said, we always ate beef and, uh, pork,  you know,  a lot,
Oh, yeah.
so
I know,
my husband did too
His parents are Austrian
and they, uh, always made sure they had a lot of meat at the table
Oh yeah,
red meat, plenty of good red meat.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
My dad could eat, a, a meal with out any vegetables at all.
Oh, my gosh.
And, uh, Susan's, you know, they had, you know meatless meals, you know.
Yeah,
yeah.
My dad  wouldn't know what to do.
Oh, gosh,
so do you,
Course, she grew up Catholic
so you know, they,  they sort of come  with the,
Oh, they did the,
there's a certain amount of meatless meals you have to have
That you do,
right,
right,
that's just part of it.
Uh-huh.
Yeah,
we didn't, my family didn't,
but when I got into the vegetarian cooking we got kind of used to that,
but my husband always did it kind of grudgingly,
he never,
Uh-huh.
There  was dishes that he really enjoyed, eating.
Uh-huh.
there were several things that he liked
but it never was really, something that he would have chosen.
It's just that I cooked
so he had to put up with it
Right.
So, but there was one thing that he couldn't stand
and that was soybeans.
I tried it like once or twice
and he just could not eat it,
so I never,
I had,
I was limited.
I had to make vegetarian meals without using soy beans,
but.
Yeah,
it's hard to get a protein content up then
Yeah,
yeah.
That's true
Yeah,
I like, I like them every now and then for a change,
it's nice.
Yeah,
some of the stuff is good,
but it just, it was a tremendous amount of cooking
Because you do have to make sure you have the right combinations of different proteins to make sure they're complete,
Uh-huh.
and  we had little kids at the time, you know,
when I was home with them, and it, it was just so much cooking,
I couldn't, I don't like to cook.
And  I'm not really that great at it
so it just turned out to be too much of a, too much, too much cooking.
So, well, I guess I'll let you get back to feeding your little one there.
No, uh,
he's all done.
He's set,
oh okay.
Yeah,
yeah,
I set him down.
Okay.
Do you like to bake at all,
or do you, do you get into that's, that,
Yeah,
we used to do that, um,
my mom, used to go crazy, every Sunday, until my dad like blew up, you know
Yeah
after he gained about eighty pounds after coming back from the Navy, she stopped doing it.
But, um, she used to have, you know, two dozen sticky buns, three bread rolls, you know, every week.
Really,
no kidding.
And, um, the  sticky buns, of course, would last, you know three or four days
and that would be it.
Yeah,
then be gone.
I know,
that's the thing about baking.
I used to, I, I don't mind baking at all
and I, I can do a pretty good pie,
we have this pie crust recipe in our family that my grandmother gave my mother
and my mother taught me how to make it.
Uh-huh.
And,  um, so I can make a pretty mean pie,
but, um, I don't do it anymore because it's just too fattening.
We had the same kind of problem.
If you make homemade bread,
Uh-huh
I mean,  it's supposed to save you money
but you eat like three times the amount of bread that you usually eat
It tastes so good.
Uh-huh,
we always, we had that bread that was, uh, um,
you ever seen the, the starter bread,
I can't remember what it's called,
they call it the, um, Amish bread here
but,
Oh, uh, yeah.
uh, it's made  with,
you just leave it out,
Yeah.
you  know, and you let it spoil sort of.
Yeah,
uh-huh,
I've heard of that, I've heard of it,
but I've never done it.
You know, yeah.
That sounds pretty good.
Yeah,
it tasted pretty good, really.
Yeah,
oh yeah.
But, uh, it's the sort of thing where you let a portion of it go bad
and then you add all these other ingredients to it,
but.
Yeah,
and then you you make the bread
but you pinch off a portion, or save a portion of it for the next time, or something.
Yeah
right,
you take some of the batter out and give it to someone else
and that's how they continue the thing.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
I know, it sounds, it always sounded,
I don't know how safe that was
Yeah,
I know it sounded strange to me too,
I figure, well you're baking it
so, you know, yeah.
Yeah
that's true,
that's, that's got to kill anything I guess,
but.
Okay,
well, I'll talk to you later.
All right,
well, yeah
thanks.
Where are you calling from by the way, Texas.
Plano.
Where?
Yeah,
Plano, in Texas.
Plano,
okay.
Are you in Texas?
No,
Falls Church, Virginia.
No kidding,
gosh it sounds so close.
Yeah,
I know we've got a good connection,
must be a, uh, T I connection,
yeah.
Yeah,
I thought for sure, I thought for sure you were in Dallas or something.
Yeah,
I, I talked to so many people from Texas
that's where practically everybody I talked to is from.
Yeah,
yeah.
I think that's why they call me because they want to get people outside the state, you know.
Yes
they're they're trying to get all different amount of people.
Well gee, my husband is from Richmond
and I went to U V A,
that's where we went.
Oh, oh really.
Yeah,
yeah.
Yeah
I went to school at, uh, well I went to school at West Virginia University,
Oh you did,
yeah.
but I grew up  right here in Falls Church, right outside D C.
Yeah,
boy we'd like to get back over to the East Coast,
I'll tell you.
It's nice over there.
Yeah,
it's sort of funny,
I have people that want to go to Dallas.
Oh, really.
Yeah,
one of my, one of my friends here, he was just talking how he's thinking of leaving the company and going to Dallas,
saying how,
Oh, yeah,
no kidding.
Well, things are doing pretty good down here,
we, we were, we tried to move over to Raleigh last year
and there just was, there was so little, such little going on in Raleigh, you know,
you couldn't get a job to save yourself over there
so we decided we'll try in a couple of years,
but, but business is,
Yeah,
yeah.
We were saying we could sell our house here and buy one down there cash, you know.
Yeah,
you probably could, you probably could,
Well Northern Virginia.
Okay.
Okay,
well it's good talking to you.
Nice talking to you too.
Take care.
Bye, bye,
Bye.
