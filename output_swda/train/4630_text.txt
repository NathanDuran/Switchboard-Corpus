Uh, I basically, uh, listen to the news from the T V.
That's probably the only time I get a chance to, uh, uh, take a look at it is the evening news
and, and then if I'm lucky, I might be able to hear something through news wise.
But, uh, other than that that's probably how I get my source unless something really tragic happens and somebody tells me it about through, uh, uh, you know, uh, through conversation or whatever
but, uh, most of the time it is through the news in the evening
so  that's about the,
You don't get  any newspapers?
Newspapers?
No,
I'm not too much in reading newspapers.
Uh, not that I don't enjoy newspapers or anything like that
but, uh, part of it is because I just don't feel like I need, the need to have them, uh, with watching the T V or whatever.
We get our weekly news around the area
and I might look through it real quick if there's something that catches my interest, uh, in regards to what's going on around the county or little bit of the state
But the majority of the time now I don't get a daily newspaper where, you know, I get tons of, uh, news coming in that kind of stuff.
I'm kind of the opposite of you.
I get all my news from  newspapers.
Oh, you do
We have,  we have two newspapers.
You read it in the morning then?
Yeah.
Two newspapers in the morning.
Uh-huh.
And, uh  I'm, uh,  in, in a government position that I'm in the news a lot
Sure.
so, uh, I, I kind of look through to see, see what, uh, I'm quoted in.
Oh, sure
But, uh,  how, how bad the quotes are every day.
To see if they did it  or if they, uh, criticize you or put something in there wrong.
Yeah.
Sure,
sure.
Or,  uh, sometimes there's, uh, letter to the editor about me
or there's a, even, uh, editorials  for  and against what I'm doing
Uh-huh,
Sure.
Sure,
exactly
But, uh, but T V, uh, the T V, I, I don't really watch, even if I'm, even if  I'm on it.
Uh-huh,
sure.
But just,
Well, that's,  that's kind of like you said then.
We, we are kind of on the opposite where I get home and, uh, while I'm cooking supper the T V is on and watching the news or trying to catch up with what is going on
and, uh, very seldom do I catch the ten o'clock
so, by that time, you know, old news is probably what I hear through the grapevine or whatever.
But, uh, unless there is a big issue going on like when we were at war then I think everybody was glued to the T V to find out what was going on.
Right.
But, uh, other  than that, no.
It's,
And that's,
C N N had the, uh,
everybody was watching C N N,
that seemed to be the  place to be  to find out what was going on on that.
Exactly,
exactly,
exactly,
sure.
Yeah,
yeah.
Uh-huh.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Well it brought kind of, uh, more of a vivid, uh, look at what was going on when they were dropping the bombs and just a lot of different things.
But, uh, yeah,
that's true.
You know you know a lot of people that read the news to, newspapers to get the news of what's going on
and, uh, other people that, you know, do it differently or don't even watch any news at all
so. But,
Well, the thing is, with, with T V, I, I, uh,
a lot of times the, the news on, uh, the local T V is so brief, you really don't get the full picture of what, uh,  what's going on.
Exactly happens.
Sure,
sure.
That's,
And,  uh, that's, that's a problem that I have is not, getting just a little brief, uh,  idea of what's happening.
But,
Oh sure,
a clip,  you know, a sentence or two
and that's about it of what went on
and, uh, they have so much other information to cover in such a short period of time.
Sure.
Right.
But  I like the weather report.
Makes  sense.
Yeah.
So, I
I alway, always, I always turn that on
Yeah,
yeah.
that's one part I watch because of, uh, I go surfing down here
and I always want to watch the weather for when the waves are going to be good.
Uh-huh.
So you're right on the coast line.
You're not, uh, further up.
You're,
Yeah.
No.
Uh-huh.
Sure.
Sure.
I suppose you watch for hurricanes coming in and things like that.
Yeah.
Sure.
Yeah.
Weather channel's good
Yeah,
that's about the only time in the, in the summer, uh, if you're watching T V for the weather, even though it's very hard to predict what's going on,
they'll kind of say, well, there's a thunderstorm warning or whatever.
This is the, what is expected,
but a lot of times things happen and change here so drastically, uh, so fast you know, where movement that was coming in has shifted or whatever
Yeah.
so.
Uh-huh.
so I can predict my, my week and where I'm going to be.
Uh-huh.
Sure.
So I can be at the, at the  beach when the waves start coming in.
to take off.
Sure.
Yeah.
That's,
sounds pretty good
so. Anyway, I don't know if our time is getting up here
or it's got to be fairly close to that
