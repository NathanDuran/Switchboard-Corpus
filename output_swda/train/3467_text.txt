I said Arlington, Texas because the other day, I was talking with somebody
and he was in Arlington, Virginia
Oh, no.
Yeah,
that's the only one I've got now for this area.
Oh, gosh, oh, gosh.
Well, anyway, we've got a easy subject.
Yes,
we do.
You go ahead first, if you'd like.
Okay,
let me think here.
Favorite,
I haven't been watching much T V lately
Yeah,
you know you get so busy.
I used to.
Yeah,
I have, uh, I have one favorite soap opera.
I still watch
and I tape because I'm not home
Oh,
And, uh, let's see,
that's GENERAL HOSPITAL,
and then, uh, at night, uh, I don't, uh, when I sit down, I don't usually sit down till almost nine o'clock when my kids get in bed
I know.
and, and, uh, then I watch,
uh, what do I watch at nine o'clock.
Let's see,
oh, well, Tuesday nights I guess, we try to catch a couple of the shows that the kids like.
Right.
And, uh,
Are they little?
I have a seven year old and a ten year old.
Yeah,
they're pretty young.
And, uh, so we usually catch, uh, FULL HOUSE,
and, uh, what's the one comes on after that.
It's a new one, uh,
I don't know,
my kids are older
Uh-huh.
so I don't, I don't know some of those shows now, like I used to
Yeah,
yeah.
Uh, other than that, uh, oh, gosh. I watch KNOTS LANDING on Thursday nights, for pure entertainment, nothing else.
Right.
Yeah.
Well I, I like the comedies.
They're just light, too.
I have to watch MURPHY BROWN
I really like,
Oh, now that is a good one.
I make a point of that.
That is.
Yeah,
if I'm home on Mondays, then I, I definitely watch her.
I love that
and I really like COACH.
I think it's, when it's good, it's just a scream.
Yeah,
yeah,
well, he's a good actor.
He really is good.
Well, he's probably playing himself.
Half the time you see these people on an interview show, they're, they act just like they do in their parts
Yeah,
yeah
He,
I saw him on JOHNNY CARSON once
and he acted about the same
Oh, God.
Well, he could very well be
Yeah,
and, uh,
So, do you watch much T V,
or,
Well, I watch more now because, well I, I had been going to school for years and have really been too busy
Uh-huh.
but this semester I'm only taking one course
and so I see MURPHY BROWN and COACH and THE WONDER YEARS.
I just make a point of seeing those.
Now, I never see that.
Well, I've got a friend that says that is just wonderful show.
Oh, it's fabulous.
Really, you should never miss that.
It, they are just gems of shows. I mean, they really, fabulous in every way
Oh, nice.
What, now what night is that on now?
Oh, that's Wednesday at, uh, seven thirty.
Wednesday at seven thirty,
oh, okay.
Yeah,
Wednesdays I, I go to church choir,
so That's my one night out and about,
Oh, yeah.
so,
Sure,
yeah,
well, maybe, maybe your husband could tape it for you sometime.
Yeah,
I should get him to do that.  Because I know,
Just so you get the idea.
It wouldn't take,  Wouldn't take much to get hooked on those
Yeah,
yeah,
uh-huh.
So, so, I watch those.
Are there any new ones this year that came out that you like
or,
Well, you know, I haven't, oh,
yeah,
we started watching NORTHERN EXPOSURE.
Well, it's not really new,
but it's still kind of new.
Uh-huh,
uh-huh.
How's that?
I haven't seen that.
I like it a lot.
It's real different.
In fact, they never thought it would be a hit.
Huh.
I mean, they'll have some things in there that almost, almost, you know, like supernatural, or something,
you know, I mean, somebody will see a figure from the past that nobody else does
or, I mean, it sounds weird,
but, it's very, uh, unique show and very well done.
Huh.
Excellent actors.
I'll have to watch for that.
I, I guess we just,
it came on after something we used to watch
Uh-huh,
uh-huh.
and I guess we just kept sitting there
and then now we make a point of watching
I can't take all these shows on because next semester I'm not going to be able to watch hardly any television.
Uh-huh
Well then, it will be mostly reruns, I guess
Yeah,
yeah.
And by the end of February, the way they do it nowadays.
Gosh. Well, we used to watch a lot of DESIGNING WOMEN,
But, uh,
but, uh I haven't seen that much lately. Since they got rid of, uh, Delta Burke and, uh brought on the new ones.
Yeah.
Yeah,
I've seen that.
Was she the, was she the best one? Was she the best one on that old show?
Oh, she was just funny.
Really?
She was really funny.
And her character was good.
I don't know that it was her in particular but just the character.
Right,
right.
So, uh,
Yeah,
they had a big fight on that show, didn't they?
Yeah,
yeah.
They were all accusing each other of everything in the world
Oh, that was awful
and who knows still, what really happened, you know.
Well, I know,
gosh, you never will, probably.
Yeah,
yeah,
so,
Well, I think the latest soap opera for people is the Kennedy trial for those who have cable.
Oh, I know.
I don't have cable.
Now I told ,
no,
we don't have that station either,
so, uh, I haven't been able to catch any of that,
but just what little we caught on the news.
It's just as wild as any soap  opera, from what I hear on the news.
Oh, I know it.
And I think he's guilty as the devil.
Well, I don't see how he couldn't be, you know.
I know,
what's in it for her.
There's never anything for you to go to trial as a witness in a case like that. Because you know they tear you to shreds, especially those rich high powered lawyers.
Yeah,
that's right.
Oh, and they said this lawyer is unbelievable.
Um.
But, they said she held up so well yesterday.
I know,
everybody was saying that
and then, in the paper said it
so, It should be interesting.
Yeah.
Oh, God.
Well, the NATIONAL ENQUIRER says
I was reading that in the supermarket line.
I never have the nerve to buy the thing.
Uh,
Oh, shoot,
well, do you watch any, uh any sports or anything like that
Says he,
or,
No,
I don't care anything about that.
Because I don't either.
I can't, I can't watch it on T V,
so
I like the ice skating,
you know, occasionally, some ice skating will come on, on a Sunday or during the Olympics
Uh-huh.
I always watch that.
I think it's so beautiful.
Yeah,
I like to catch the gymnastics sometimes, too.
Oh, yeah,
that's good.
