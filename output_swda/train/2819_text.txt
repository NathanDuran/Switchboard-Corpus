Okay,
so, um, how do think, how do you think we've changed in the last ten to twenty years?
Uh, I'm at a little bit of a loss,
you know, I don't know,
ten years ago,
see I'm what, I'm about, uh, twenty-eight now
so when I was eighteen,
Uh-huh.
things haven't changed a whole lot.
Really.
People are being a little more, oh, I don't know, a little a little less bigoted in some ways,
I don't know
Uh-huh.
seems to me.
Well,
I guess I'm like my parents.
The younger generation gets away with hell,
but, uh,
Yeah.
Well, it seems to me that civic freedoms are more restricted
but that may just be because I've changed.
You know, I used to live up north.
Down here, Dallas, seems to me, the police are militant
Really.
but, uh,
Where'd you live up,
where'd you live at,
I lived in Akron, Ohio.
Oh, did you?
I'm from , Illinois,
so.
Oh.
How long, how long you been in Dallas?
Oh, about eight years.
Oh, really?
In fact in the eight years I've been here it seems to me it gets more and more, gets to be more and more restrictive place to live. I think,
Yeah, uh
you know, uh, as you're talking like police and stuff like that it's definitely a tough job to do.
Yeah,
I think it's,
crime has gone, got a lot worse in the last last ten, fifteen years,
Oh, yeah,
I agree.
and maybe that has a lot to do with it.
Yeah,
I, I definitely think that has gotten a lot worse,
and you know, I, I think there's,
to me there seems to be a little bit of a decline in the family values.
Yeah,
that's true.
So,
That's true,
But, uh,
I'd say my own personal lifestyle has improved
Yeah.
but that's more a matter of,
you know I'm no longer a teenager in high school.
Yeah.
Yeah,
I think there's more pressure like on both parents to work, and things like that than there used to be
and,
Hello.
Somebody's at the door.
So.
Hang on just a second.
Okay.
off Okay.
But, uh, I don't know,
that's just, that's one thing I see, I see a lot more, you know, double income families and a lot more like baby sitters raising the kids and things like that, I guess.
Yeah,
that's true,
it's getting more and more expensive to live.
Yeah,
that's for sure.
You can't, you can't make it,
Yeah,
without it hardly,
that's right.
I guess, when I was growing up, it was, it was still the ideal to get a, get a home and buy house,
and these days you see a lot of people living in apartments forever
Yeah.
Yeah
you know, you just don't buy a house,
just because they can't get into one,
yeah,
that's right.
Yeah,
the ways our tax laws and stuff are structured, you can't ever catch a break until you can get into a house in a lot of ways,
Yeah.
so. Yeah,
that's, that's a good point
so, I'm trying to think of anything else that's changed over the last ten or twenty years.
Yeah,
for me it's kind of hard,
I don't know.
I think,
I don't know, I think the middle class is shrinking and the, uh, lower class is expanding
Oh, yeah,
I agree.
and sooner or later there's going to, there's going to be a turn around.
Well, I hope so, you know, at some point
but I don't know at what point,
But I think it's going to be at the expense of the middle class, uh
Yeah,
so, usually is I think.
Yeah.
It's, uh,
It's hard for me to say.
I hope it happens, because I'd be one of those that gets caught.
But on the other hand, there's a lot of injustice that needs to be, be changed.
Yeah,
that's right.
Do you work at T I?
Yeah.
Do you?
Yeah.
What, uh, department do you work in?
I'm in semiconductor.
Are you?
I'm in semiconductor division too.
Yeah.
So. How long you been with them, since you moved down here?
About eight years,
yeah.
Um, I'm over at the Center One building.
Yeah,
so am I.
Are you really.
What floor?
Two.
I'm on the seventh floor.
Well,
How about that.
Well, it's a small world.
So, so let's see,
second floor, you work with, uh, linear.
Yeah.
Do you. Do you, uh, do you know Alec Morton?
Yeah,
I've probably seen him around.
Oh, you do, huh.
Well, he comes up and pushes us around
so, uh, so I'm pretty familiar with,
Are you D A D or something up there?
Huh?
Are you D A D or something?
Yeah
Yep,
you must know him.
His reputation precedes him.
Yeah,
well, seventh floor.
Yeah,
T A D,
Well, uh, he, uh, boy, he comes up there and gives us all kinds of grief.
They, they say it's what makes him happy is to give us D A D grief,
so I can believe it
but,
Well.
Yeah,
let's see, if you've been in Dallas eight years, I guess that's about how long,
I've been in here about eight years, too, I guess.
Um, been with T I like twelve,
but I started out in Lubbock.
Lubbock is,
I don't know,
I guess if this is the only place you've lived, Lubbock is a lot different than Dallas.
Yeah,
flat, dry and dirty,
Yeah.
Yeah,
but the people all seem to be a lot more laid back, too,
I mean, here in Dallas everything is just real rush, rush.
Yeah,
I lived in the country for several years,
and living in the city is a whole different uh, social structure
Oh yeah.
but, uh,
Well, I got some friends that, uh,
seems like he went to school at like DeVry.
Is there a DeVry in Akron?
I don't even know
Oh,
I haven't been up there in years.
Oh, I see,
well, he went to school somewhere in Ohio,
and he's from that area,
and, uh, he works over in the Park, Park Central building I think
but, uh, I haven't talked to him in a while,
but, um, yeah,
he, he misses it.
He used to go back twice or three times a year, you know, because he missed it.
Sounds like you haven't been back there in a while.
No,
I haven't been back in ten, fifteen years.
You still have relatives back there
or,
Yeah,
I do,
I just haven't had a chance to get back
Oh.
Catch them next year probably.
Really.
Well, let's see,
how, how long are we supposed to talk here?
I don't know,
I think we ran out of social, social changes to talk about,
so.
Yeah,
well my kids are probably needing me to go
so
Okay,
all right,
well, it's nice talking to you.
Yeah,
Talk to you later.
All righty,
bye.
Bye.
