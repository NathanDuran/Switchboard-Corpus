Well, tell me about your home.
Okay.
Uh, right now we're living in,
well it's me, my wife and, uh, two young boys.
And, uh, right now we're in a, uh, I guess it's either a zero lot line or a garden home. Which you might call it.
Uh-huh.
So we don't have a, a big yard. Uh,
but, uh, when my wife and I first moved in, it was just the two of us.
So it was enough.
Uh-huh.
Uh, and it's, uh, I guess what they call a story and a half.
Because it's not a full two story. Where, you know, everything on top is on bottom.
Yeah.
So, it's got real high ceilings on half the house
and the other half is just standard sized ceilings.
Huh.
And, uh, it's about a five year old house now.
It sounds nice.
It's, uh, pretty nice.
Unfortunately, the builder who built it went out of business already
Oh, yeah?
Yeah.
It was a,
Landmark is the one who built it.
Yeah.
Well, you know, these guys that gambled high lost big you know.
Yeah.
That's true.
And, uh I'm insulating myself from that problem.
Exactly what happened to them.
I'm building my own house.
Oh, that's nice.
And as I look out the window of my trailer, I can envision all the insulation that's going up today
Oh, really.
Yeah.
Are you doing it yourself?
Yeah.
Wow.
I used to be a builder.
Oh, that's nice.
And I retired about five years ago  and  started college.
Oh, I  see.
Huh.
And now I'm a college educated builder
There's still no work, you know.
Yeah.
So, uh,  you know, I decided this summer that, uh, you know, we had enough credit on the credit cards to buy the materials
so I did.
That's great.
And, uh, see the, the, the state has a law that says you cannot borrow the money to build your own home.
is that so?
I didn't know that.
You can borrow the  money to pay somebody else to build your house
but you can't borrow the money to build your own.
Well that sounds kind of dumb.
Well, it's to protect the, the banks from guys that say yeah I want to build my own house and go out a build a spec home
Uh-huh.
and then it doesn't sell
and then the  bank's  holding the bag.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Well.
Huh.
As, as you know, anything that involves the government is, works half as well as it's supposed to  costs three times as much. Right?
That's right
Hence the savings and loan problem we have.
Yeah,
that's true.
But, uh, you know, my home is, uh, fairly simple.
It's designed to be added on to.
Uh-huh.
That's good.
Yeah.
Well, I figure it's just me and my wife
but, you know, I like to do stuff with my hands and whatnot,
so  I want  to have a shop.
Yeah.
How big a lot do you got it on?
Ten acres.
Wow.
That's nice.
That's real nice.
Well, yeah.
It's really nice too because I can't see my nearest neighbor.
He's on the other side of a hill.
Oh.
And my second nearest neighbor is a dot on the horizon.
Seriously.
God.
That's pretty good.
Well, in the winter time, I can see, see another guy
but, you know, he's
Uh-huh.
I can just make out his place, you know. I've got a thirty mile view to the east and about ten miles to the north.
Yeah.
Yeah.
And, uh,
Oh, that's pretty good.
Yeah.
Well, I took a lot of time in choosing this site because the, the house has no heating or air conditioning.
Uh-huh.
Oh, you, you, you don't plan on putting any, any of that in?
Well, it's got a, a very small furnace.
Uh-huh.
And a, uh, we'll use a wood burning stove as well.
Yeah.
But, in the house itself, I've been working inside, you know, these, these many months
Uh-huh.
and I have not had to use the heat.
Wow.
Because it's all geothermal.
Yeah.
That's pretty good.
And with all the,
see I've got,
on the south side is all glass.
Well, as much as I could get in it, you know. And, uh, the east side is glass.
Yeah.
I've got one, two, three, four, five, six windows in the east side on forty-eight feet.
So it's almost all glass.
Wow.
And,  uh,
My  wife would love that
Oh, yeah.
I mean,  you know.  There's no place in the house where you can stand and not see four windows.
She loves  lots of windows.
That's great.
So, uh,
Is it a single story?
Well, not really.
It's, uh, it's on the side of a hill.
Oh, I see.
So the first, you know,
the, the, the,
what I call residential level at the side that's in the hill is about four feet deep.
Uh-huh.
Um, I see.
And the side that's on the, uh, the other side is about six feet high.
Oh.
So I've got a pretty good grade there.
Yeah.
And then when I put the verandas which will be twelve feet out all the way around on the north, south and east sides that will define the shop.
Uh-huh.
Yeah,
that's kind of like, like a Victorian style?
Exactly.
Yeah.
I, I've always liked that.
The,
you know, I, we don't have much yard
but I built a small deck in the back.
Uh-huh.
But, you know, I, I see these magazines where, you know, dig your, your own deck.
Uh-huh.
I, I kind of wish I had them, those size property and, and, uh, one with a grade on it so I can build a real nice deck.
