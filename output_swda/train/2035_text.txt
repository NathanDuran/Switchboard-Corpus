Hi Diana.
Hi
Have you all been able to do much as a family these days?
Pardon me.
Have you all been able to do much as, uh, as a full family these days, all of you.
Oh, yes,
we've, uh, been, um, we've gone other, you know, all kinds of places,
we go out to dinner,
Yeah.
we take the kids to the park,
and, uh, you know, whenever we, he, my husband has time off or something, we take them to the zoo,
or we, you know, we do everything we can possibly as a family.
Do you work outside the home?
No,
I don't.
Yeah,
I don't either,
it makes it a little bit easier, I think, that way.
Yeah,
it does,
an, an then, uh, you know, my husband enjoys spending time with the kids, you know,
he'll, he'll take them out just to be with them.
Yeah.
So he, they can have time with him an.
So you have a break too.
Right,
so and we, uh, we try to teach our kids as much as we can at home, you know, we have, we try to spend like Monday nights, we call it family home evening, and, have our kids, uh, you know, have little lessons with them, and, you know, just see, count, see how things are going in our family and, you know, teach them about their grandparents or something like that. Bring out pictures of them so they get to know them
Uh-huh.
and, we just do all kinds of fun things like that
an.
Yeah,
we have family that's far away.
It sounds like you might too.
Yeah,
we do,
so they, you know, the only way they know their grandparents is by pictures.
Yeah.
And, uh,
Right,
and phone calls that's about, about it.
Yeah,
right
and, uh, you know, they, we, you know, we go to the park
or we go in the backyard and sit down
an,
That's yeah, that's what we mostly do, pretty simple things.
Yeah.
Especially since my youngest one is excuse me, only fourteen months.
Right.
She, she's really getting to the age where she's playing, and likes to go places.
Uh-huh.
Yeah,
and with, you know, me being at home and just having the one income, you know, you don't have, this lot of extra money to, to do a lot of, you know, extra things.
That's right.
So, you, you make more fun than, you know.
You know the kids just think it's wonderful just maybe to go get an ice cream cone or, yeah, or, uh, you know, go get a bag of M and M's or something like that,
Oh that's a big thrill for them.
they, they think that's a lot of fun.
So we just, we try to spend as much time as we can.
We, you know
our, our whole weekends are are devoted to our children except for we might go out, you know, one evening or something,
Yeah.
but during the day, you know, it's all devoted to our kids
and they come, go to church with us
and so.
Yeah,
that's true.
Yeah,
so.
Have, um, have you ever been to the Science, it's called the Science Place?
Yes,
yes,
that's what.
We we haven't lived here too long
and we went there a couple of weeks ago
and, uh,
Uh-huh,
the kids thought that was wonderful.
Oh, yeah,
we,
I guess there's Science Place One and Science Place Two.
We've only been in, I think it's Science Place Two.
I, is, I'm not sure which one we went into,
it was about a year or so ago, when we went.
The one we went in had, uh,
the thing that sticks out most in my mind is that, like a kid's place area.
Uh-huh,
yeah.
That really seem, they really seemed to go wild in there.
Yeah,
yeah
they had a lot of fun in there
and, uh, there's, uh, there's some petting, you know, like, uh, uh,
I think it's Owens Country Farms has a free petting, you know, like a farm that you can go to
and the kids can pet animals and stuff.
Where's that.
That's on Plano Road,
uh, it's like in Richardson you go up Plano Road,
it's like a little bit past Campbell and Plano Road
Uh-huh,
uh-huh.
And that's a lot of fun.
Oh yeah.
They have tours going through there
and, uh, the kids think that was a lot of fun, too.
Oh, that does sound like fun.
It's a little bit of a ways,
We take, you know, whenever we take them to Showbiz
or they think it's wonderful just to go to McDonald's, you know,
they don't go for the food
they go for the, to play around
and, There's another place in Mesquite called Monkey Business,
That's right.
Uh-huh.
and it's a indoor fun park
and it has a bunch of different rides for kids.
That's sounds fun too.
And parents get in free
and it's like, during the week,
it's like five dollars admission per child, all day.
And, and you said about Plano and Campbell is the petting,
The petting farm,
yeah.
That sounds fun
I think maybe we'll try to do that.
Yeah,
yeah
and the one in Mesquite is, uh, Scyene exit.
Uh-huh.
And it's, it's, uh,
the kids just had a wonderful time there,
they, you know, you just pay that admission,
and then all the, the, the rides are free.
You know, of course, they have all the little video games and, you know, those little quarter rides, you know, to, and stuff like that
but, they thought that was lot of fun.
Yeah.
You can have birthday parties there
an, I think that was better than like Showbiz Pizza cause there's more for them to do.
Because they can just do,
you don't have to have tokens for everything.
Yeah,
right.
Yeah.
So they had a lot of fun.
That does sound like fun.
Well I've gotten some good ideas from you
Yeah.
I, we try to do a lot of things as a family and, you know, inexpensively as possible,
so.
Definitely.
Well, I think, I don't know if we've done five minutes
but I'm sure that will be good.
Yeah,
that will be good,
yeah.
It was good talking to you.
Well it was good talking to you.
I really appreciate your suggestions.
Oh, no problem.
Well, take  care.
Okay,
bye-bye,
Bye-bye.
