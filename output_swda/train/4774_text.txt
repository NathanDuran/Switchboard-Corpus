Been on the line for awhile.
I almost forgot what the topic was.
Okay.
Uh,  based,
Uh,  but I know what it is.
Oh, okay.
Good.
Uh, let me see.
I, I, I, I, I'm kind of,
I don't,
you know, I'm, I'm kind of in the middle.
I, I think it's a great idea
Uh-huh.
but when it comes to me, it's like, almost an insult, you know,
so it's
I, I've come from the teaching field.
Right.
So do  I
So,  so it's just like I don't know. I, I guess, I guess I'd have to go with, uh,
Uh-huh.
But I, I, I would, I would probably go for, for going ahead and doing it, you know. If it's got to be done for everyone.
Right.
I think if it's got to be done for one person in the company, it should be random testing, it should be for everybody.
Right.
You know, when they answer the company, I think it'll make it a lot easier
Right.
Yeah.
I don't know, I come from the teaching field too
and it sort of, uh,
it's a pro and a con
I don't know where to stand on it.
Yeah.
I'm more or less, if they told me I had to well then fine,
but  if, you know, if they made me then I'd probably,
Yeah.
if I had my druthers I'd probably say well no
you know just this,
Yeah.
You kind of  goes into your privacy
and you know, but I guess if they,
Right.
you know, you know, there's, uh,
I guess there's some companies that aren't, that are doing it.
Uh-huh.
And it, it seems to be working out
so,
Yeah,
Yeah.
Right.
And, uh, anybody who, uh, gee, is, you know, doesn't accept the rehab program then they're, more or less, getting laid off.
See, that's hard.
that's a,
it's really weird issue.
I'm  sort of  on the fence about it.
Yeah.
Yeah.
But I,
you know, that, that's what's they're coming across as is some of the companies anyhow.
Oh, we can get you into a drug program.
But then you wear that stigma you know
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
yeah.
Then I kind of hear it goes into like, uh,
Right.
Anything with a,
you know, if you drink a lot of caffeine  or,
Oh,  I didn't know that.
Yeah,
somebody was saying, telling me if you drink it in, you know, an awful lot of caffeine, that that can show up as a positive test.
Um.
I know I'm an epileptic
so I'd probably test positive  and  and then I'd have a heck of a time explaining what drug is in my system, you know
Yeah.
See  things like that
so,
Yeah.
And a lot of times, those are the things I don't like to disclose to an employer because then they don't want to have anything  to do with you
Right,
right.
Uh-huh.
You know, it's very personal.
I wouldn't want to have it disclosed  because  then I'd always wonder if they fired me, you know, why did you fire me
See that's,
Yeah.
That's where I kind of get into,
cause it kind of gets into your personal life, you know.
And what's kind of next.
Uh-huh.
Yeah.
The what?
Orwell.
Huh.
Oh.
Yeah.
and I
I'd hate to have to,
if I had my choice between a company that did testing and a company who didn't
Right.
Yeah
Right.
But I can understand why they need it with all the, you know, train accidents and everything else.
So do you think they'll kind of push into the teaching field eventually?
I kind of think they will.
I think they will too because, uh, you know, it's just going to follow.
Yeah.
I don't know. I, we haven't had any of it in our school system.
So, uh, you know  hopefully, we won't
Yeah.
We haven't either.
Yeah.
But I, I, I just kind of think it's heading that way though, you know. It's just, because it's just hitting to close to home with the kids and stuff
and I just I just kind of think it's going to eventually head that way.
Right.
Well and eventually it's going to be not only the
you know,  the kids are  going to be under scrutiny, it's going to be the teachers.
Yeah.
Right.
And if they can test the teachers, that gives them the full right to test the kids.
Right.
And then they, you know, caught everybody.
Yeah
