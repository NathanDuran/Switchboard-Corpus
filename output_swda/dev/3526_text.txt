Hi,
well, I guess,
which one have you got right now?
Or,
Well, I, uh,
couple of them,
I, at the moment, use an A S T two eighty-six
and I got a leading edge
and I got a American one and had a I B M one,
but
My, my,
just a couple.
What do you have
Uh, I've got an Omega
and I've got a, uh, generic three eighty, or four eighty-six machine.
Oh, yeah?
Yeah,
it's very, very generic.
What did you do, put it together?
Yeah,
and, and, uh, upgraded it and put things in there and dibbled and dabbled
and now, now it's, now it's a fast machine
Well, that's,
Yeah.
That's all I got to say for it.
Yeah.
What do you use it for?
Huh?
What do you use it for?
Uh, work,
uh, I'm a contract programmer.
Oh, yeah?
What kind of programs do you,
Uh, anything
Okay,
I mean like business programs
or, Man.
Uh, I've done business programming, you know, scientific applications like, you know, petroleum science stuff and, Uh, uh, test equipment
and I did the, I, I did one that was, the demonstration of a touch, touch screen for a company that sells, uh, touch screens.
It was kind of fun.
Uh-huh,
Put a little bitty portable computer in there and a plasma display. And make it look like things like, uh, you know, attack simulators and , and all sorts of little things you'd want to put your finger on the screen for.
Huh.
Well, that's,
Well, that sounds interesting.
Matter of fact, uh, I guess you do, uh, you get a lot of graphics in there, I imagine, huh.
Oh, yeah,
definitely.
That's where the speed helps out.
Uh, yeah,
unfortunately the little portable P C that was plugged on the back was only a seven and a half megahertz, eighty, eighty-six.
It's like slow out the
Yep,
that will, that will, slow you up
Huh?
Well, I, I do, uh, uh, programming for C N C turret presses and uh, cat cam system type things
Uh-huh.
and, uh, really need a faster system.
Uh, I got a new line that I, I sell metal fabricating equipment, and cat cam systems, and tooling, et cetera.
Uh-huh.
Uh,
I know a guy that upgrades, uh, for a reasonable cost.
Who is that?
Uh, his name is T Q or something like that.
And my notebook is somewhere around here
See if I can make my telephone cord stretch far enough.
I've tried to do is get this outfit to give me one
Uh, he's, uh, up in,
Huh?
That's how I got my other ones by selling their product for them.
They not only give me a demonstrator, but the hardware as well as the software.
Uh-huh.
And as they, And as they go to the next one I just keep the,
Oh, that works.
that's why I have so many different levels of P C around at the moment.
Uh, here it is.
A T S Computers.
A T S?
Uh-huh.
And where are they at?
Uh, do you know where, uh, Custer is?
Oh, yeah.
Okay,
he's, uh, uh, south of Renner on, on Custer.
And there is a little bitty mall that looks kind of like, or, strip kind of center.
In Richardson there.
Huh?
In Richardson?
Uh-huh.
I know where you mean.
There is a Mobil and all that kind of uh, on that one corner,
that's about Lookout there, I think, isn't it.
Right,
it's, it's, it's just south of there.
Yeah.
It's a little place, looks like a castle.
Yeah.
Kind of, uh, little guy in there.
He, he, uh, gives reasonable prices.
Oh.
Like I, I traded my, uh, three eighty-six for the four eighty-six for about six hundred.
Really?
Well, that's a good deal.
Yeah,
it was pretty reasonable.
Yeah.
But, uh, uh, he,
and he does a good job
and he, he, he, uh, guarantees everything he sells.
Uh, there is a lot,
you ever go by Lucky Computer there?
Uh-huh,
yeah.
I used to,
when I was putting shop floor computers together for guys, I'd go and get their units and put them together and go and interface the stuff with our systems.
Uh-huh.
Haven't been doing much of that for the last year or so.
So I, I don't know where those guys are at these days.
But I, ,
Uh, they, they're up there in that mall. Uh, just below Campbell. Or that strip, strip, center.
Yeah.
Yeah.
They're still doing business. Big business, apparently.
I tell you, those prices have just, unbelievably come down.
Uh-huh,
oh, yeah,
I was amazed I was able to get this four eighty-six for six hundred even with a trade in,
you know, it's like, wow
Yeah.
That works,
I'll go do that
I,
And boy that thing screams now.
Yeah,
I was kind of surprised how rapidly they bypassed, the three eighty-six.
That wasn't alive for but maybe two years.
Uh-huh.
Well, I thought was funny that they kept pushing the three eighty-six S X even though the, the price difference is about ten dollars.
Is that right?
That's it?
Yeah,
it, when it comes on the manufacturing floor it's about ten bucks.
I'll be darned.
Yeah.
Huh, well,
