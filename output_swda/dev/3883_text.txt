Okay.
So how do you just figure ,
Well, you know, it depends upon our weather here. You know,
today was a beautiful day
it was like, uh, uh, summer day.
It was seventy degrees
so so I dressed in, uh, uh, a light weight skirt,
Wow.
it's a, uh, ultra suede skirt and a blouse with a sweater, cardigan over it.
Uh-huh.
Because I had some appointments at the office today, some interviews
and so I had to dress up anyway
and then I wore heels, you know.
Uh-huh.
But when it rains a lot, which is has been doing here a lot lately, uh, very often, you know, wear, uh, pants and boots you know.
Oh.
So how do you dress?
Well, um, I'm going to talk about when I was working as a teacher and when I  was working at now.
Okay.
Um, when I was a teacher, um, in Utah, I would generally wear, um, dresses and heels and things like that,
Uh-huh.
and  even when it, um, rained and snowed I just braved it
and I wore heels anyway
Yeah.
And,
I,  I can see,
I, I've been a teacher so has my daughter
and I know that we very often wore heels despite the fact that,  it was tiring.
I know,
it might kill you to go up and  walk up to  the door
That's right.
but you're going to look nice for the kids
That's right
and it always makes you feel like you're a bigger person than the kids, right?
Oh, oh, yeah.
Well, I need all the height I can get
Yeah,
I do too.
So to be taller than some of the boys in the bigger grades,  uh, older grades, I had  to wear heels.
Oh, yeah.
Uh-huh.
Yeah,
we too. Um,
if it was it looked really dangerous then I would wear boots
but then I would change, um, into heels,  as soon as I got  to my desk.
Uh-huh.
So, um,
Of course, we wear, uh, an unlined boots, you know,
it has a heel on it.
They're the kind of boots that I wear to work
and we wear them, you know,
they're a leather boot that you wear
and as I said they have a regular heel on them, high heel.
Oh.
And they wear them, we wear them a lot with shirts and things.
Uh, it's kind of a,
I can't say constant down here in Texas that you wear these boots.
They're not a cowboy boot,
but they're just a real pretty boot,
but they keep your feet nice and toasty from the rain.
Oh.
As I have a private high school that I run here and so when I'm interviewing a parent, of course I feel like I need to wear heels you know, and look like I'm a business person. You know, because the children will tease about where's your motorcycle, if you wear boots too often, you know.
Sure.
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
Yeah.
Huh. Well, um,
Of course, you probably wear coats a lot.
Yeah, um,
the first two years I was in a room where they didn't heat it
So I did,
Oh, my goodness
so then you had to.
Yeah,
and then the third year we, um, got heating
so it was nice
Yes.
Then things improved, right?
Right,
uh-huh.
But of course, here we wear a light weight jacket a lot  you know, you know,
Oh, that's  nice.
and, uh, that's very seldom
we, it depends upon our winter.
We have a few days you might wear a coat, winter coat, you know,
but most of the time you can wear a sweater
and we just don't wear coats much.
We often laugh about even when it turns chilly.
We're wearing something lightweight or no jacket because we're so used to running around like that.
Uh-huh.
Oh. Nice.
Well
It's really different.
Let's put it that way.
Are you not teaching anymore?
Uh, no,
we, we moved to Iowa
and, um, I'm working at a day care right now.
I see.
And so the way I dress is really different because I'm working in the nursery room with kids from six months to like twenty months.
Oh, so you don't wear heels anymore I'll bet.
Yeah,
I wear, uh, tennis shoes,  and  jeans and things that, you know, are sort of, um,
Yeah,
uh-huh.
More practical.
not,
yes,
it doesn't matter if I have to wash it a hundred times or something.
When you were teaching, did you ever have, uh, uh, a blue jean day or anything like that?
Yeah,
but I never wore jeans because, um, I thought that was too casual
Yeah, well,
For,
I know that  some of the schools they have, uh, country western day or something like that one, you know, or tacky day,
and I always thought it was kind of out of, got out of hand when the teachers looked real tacky too.
Yeah,
really.
It's all right for the students,
they look tacky a lot
but I didn't think teachers should, you know.
Yeah,
that's how I feel too.
Yeah.
Do you like, uh, uh, Iowa?
Um, oh, it, there's some good things about it
but I've seen. A lot of things I'm not used to yet, um,
Where did you live before?
Um, we lived in Utah before
and, and I grew up in California.
Oh, well, that's quite a change from California to Utah,
