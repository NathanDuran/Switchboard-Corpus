This is Archie.
Hi, Archie.
I'm Sharon.
Have you seen DANCING WITH WOLVES?
Yeah.
I've seen that,
that's, uh, that was a really good movie.
Probably one of the best things about it was the scenery
and, uh, I thought the story was pretty good, too.
I, I think Kevin Costner did a really good job with it.
Have you ever lived in that part of the country?
No.
I haven't.
Have you ever visited it?
Um, I've visited the Wyoming area.
I'm not sure exactly where DANCES WITH WOLVES was filmed.
I think it was the black hills of South Dakota.
Could be.
I, I haven't been to South Dakota.
Have, have you been up to that?
Well, I lived in Omaha for five, winters,
Oh.
Okay.
and that rolling kind of, uh,
Terrain.
Yeah.
Is, is fairly .
The thing that I thought was interesting was that the critics,
apparently it's going to win everything.
Really?
Uh, and I had been told, you know, you wouldn't notice that it was three hours long, and all this, kind of,
That's true.
I agree with that.
Um, I, I noticed yesterday in the paper, something said that it,
I think it's been nominated for twelve awards
and, and all the critics initially said that, you know, it wouldn't go anywhere, that it was just going to be a dud.
So, it, it has surprised everybody.
Well, the interesting thing was is I had heard that,
and I, I, I tend to, I think, overreact occasionally when somebody tells me it's that great.
And, and it was, the thing is, it was, it was a good story.
Uh-huh.
Right.
And, and, and I guess that's what I really like.
Although, I must admit I did look at my watch after about an hour.
Did you?
Yeah.
Have you seen SLEEPING WITH THE ENEMY?
No.
I've heard, I've heard that's really great, though.
you have to go see that one.
And how about SILENCE OF THE LAMB?
No,
Go.
You must really keep up.
I do.
I go every weekend
I, I, uh,
those are two definite must see movies, I think.
Well, isn't, isn't SLEEPING WITH THE ENEMY, isn't that a,
is it, is it a terror movie
or is it just suspenseful?
It's suspenseful.
I don't think it's very
I mean, there's not really any, uh, blood and guts in it or anything like that.
It's, it's more suspense.
Um, the other one, SILENCE OF THE LAMBS, is kind of a, a gory movie, if, if somebody's not into that kind of stuff.
It's, it's pretty graphic at points.
But, uh, I think they're both excellent movies.
Do you, do you listen to Gary Cogill?
No. Huh-uh. *two utts
Is, uh,
do you know who he is?
Yeah.
Somebody in South Carolina told me about him.
He's a, the movie critic.
Um, oh, you've, oh,
okay.
He's a movie critic on channel eight in Dallas.
Yeah.
And he does, uh, he has a talk show on the, K L I F.
Anyway, it's on from seven to nine, or something.
And, and, and people call in
and it's, if you keep up with movies, it's kind of interesting.
There's a certain a mount of dribble that they do.
They've got, uh, they've got a couple of kids, ten or twelve years old,
and they call in
and they review movies.
But it's, uh
Oh.
he, anyway, he,
it's interesting.
You listen to him
and then you, you go watch the movie.
In fact, they had, people had just seen,
I was listening Sunday night a little bit when, I was going to pick up my daughter.
Uh-huh.
But, anyway, it was, uh, the,
it, it's interesting, though,
or did he just do it?
I think that, I think he really,
his heart was in it,
but I, I don't think he really knew it was going to be as big as it was.
I think it was something that he really wanted to do.
He wanted to direct it,
he wanted to, to star in it.
You know, he, he enjoyed the story line
and I think he just really he really wanted it.
And whether it, whether it won all kinds of awards or whether it just was okay at the box office, I think he would have been happy.
Because I think that, I think he did a good job
and, and the self-satisfaction he got out of it is much greater than any awards that they can give him.
Do you know who the guy was that was playing the, uh, the, the wagon driver?
Um.
A little piece of trivia.
You know, the guy when he first headed out from the army post.
Yeah.
Who,
no
I don't know who that guy is.
He, he plays on MURPHY BROWN.
Oh, he does?
Yes.
He's, he's Eldon, her housepainter.
As a recurring character every week?
Oh.
Can you, believe that?
No,
now see, I'd, I'd a never put those two together.
That's, that's one of those interesting pieces of trivia that somebody said, did you notice that?
Huh-uh.
I thought, no, it's really funny.
But I thought, it, it,
you think back,
and yeah,
it was him, but with a you know, with the beard and all that stuff.
Yeah.
I mean, it's, uh,
Yeah,
real scruffy looking
Yeah.
Real scruffy looking,
and it it was really funny, it's, uh, that, that he winds up playing in the movie.
But I thought, it's good that, you know,
it was a lot of fun.
Yeah.
I don't know how long this conversation is supposed to go
but we're at about five minutes.
I should think we've done enough.
You think so?
I mean, I haven't been watching my watch.
Um, I guess,
yeah.
Does it usually cut off?
Is that what, it does?
Well, I don't know.
Why do we end this thing?
It used to, it used to just automatically cut off
I think it just says hang up.
but it says when the conversation is over just say your good-byes and hang up.
So, I, I guess so.
Why don't we do that?
Okay.
Good-bye Sharon.
Good talking to you Archie
