Uh, well, uh, to begin,
I guess, uh, space is, uh, real important, I think,
so it's real vital to the future of not only our kids but every generation until the end of time, I guess.
So.
Yeah,
I, I agree
Uh.
it's definitely new frontier stuff.
So, uh,
but, uh, I'm not too up-to-date on the space, on the space frontier,
but, uh, I guess they're going, going pretty far into it now.
Um, Star Wars is not too far I don't think.
But, uh,
I, I, I worked on some of it at T I once upon a time.
Oh, have you.
Yeah.
So what do you know about it.
Well, actually I'm, I, I'm quite versed lately.
I get on a computer network all the time,
and people are talking about, about the current space program all the time.
They're talking about new rockets that they're designing now that, you know, are just like science fiction, you know,
it's like they, take off, you know,
and then they land, with the, with the, you know,
the afterburners are going, you know, not like space shuttle landing, you know, gliding down, but straight down to the landing pad.
Really.
Oh, my gosh.
Yeah,
it's called V C X or something like that.
Also called Delta Clipper, which is a decent name for something like that.
Wow.
Well, I don't know.
You think you'd, you think you'd, uh, go up in space if you had a chance?
Oh, yeah
Do you,
I think I would.
I think that'd be neat.
I think I would just sitting here talking about it,
but if the time came, it'd be real nervous.
I'd be scared,
scared me worse than Six Flags roller coaster.
That'd be pretty hairy.
Well, you know, I had a car, uh, uh, a tire come off of a car,
so you know, I, like I know what it's like to
Yeah,
imagine.
Depending on what was left of my technology to get me home
Right,
right.
So, well, I guess they're talking about people going to the moon and stuff, now, wherever. And opening up those stations, whatever, filling them.
Yeah,
they're talking about doing that again, too.
Uh-huh.
I don't know if we'll ever see that up there.
Well at least we're going to have a space station supposedly in the next few years.
Oh, really.
Yeah,
and they're going to put,
That's all beyond my imagination really.
Yeah.
But, science fiction books,
I mean, you look at the Jetsons, you know, cartoon show, and it's not too far fetched what, what they all had in those cartoons,
so you never know.
Oh, yeah,
yeah.
Any of that stuff from the Jetsons, from that cartoon, that you would never imagine would come, become possible, and now you, we have a lot of those,
so,
Uh-huh.
So you never know what, what may occur,
but as far as me seeing it, you know, I don't know
Yeah.
I don't know,
but I think it's real vital important for the future, you know generations to come,
Uh-huh.
so.
Yeah,
I, uh,
it's, it's, it's something definitely that, uh, you know,
it's, it's, uh, got the extra little oomph of interest.
Yeah.
Uh.
I'm sure it'll draw a lot more interest too, once it becomes, you know, like it's more possible,
but when they start showing the drawings and all that, I'm sure, you know, when they,
Yeah.
Yeah,
I wish, uh,
like, uh, Boeing or McDonald Douglas or something like that was supposed to buy, uh, a space shuttle sooner or later and just make it, you know, purely commercial
Right.
Uh-huh.
and they'd go up, you know, and do things
and,
So did they scratch those, uh, that Star Wars deal, you know, they one we was all worried about the "they" in this sentence should probably be a Russia and all that?
Oh.
No,
it's still probably going,
but I don't know whether, it, it, research will go on.
Yeah,
but the economy the way it is all over, they probably cut back on on that, because it's not,
Oh, yeah.
Well, they're, they're going to be cutting back so much on just, you know, the number of troops we've got in Europe and the number of troops we have here.
Right.
Yeah,
I know,
and then,
But, uh, Russia's still going to have missiles,
they're still going to be subs and things.
Yeah,
and we don't know who's handling them now
Yeah.
so that's a whole different story now.
Latest I heard it was just going to be Russia that, Russia itself that was going to have them.
Oh, really.
At least that was, you know, that's what everybody says.
Oh, yeah,
yeah,
we want only Russia to have them.
Uh-huh.
And now they're saying, Yeah,
yeah,
you're a republic,
you don't want those,
you don't want those.
Some crazy hit man over there so, with those little republics or whatever
they splitting it all up now,
and one of them crazy crazy guys get a hold of it,
Uh-huh.
you never know.
But that, the guy that's taken over for Gorbachev, he's supposed to be, he's supposed to be on our side, isn't he.
Pretty much.
One hopes.
Uh-huh.
I think we went through him though to get to Gorbachev on a lot of subjects
so,
Uh-huh.
But that way, you can't never tell that.
Yeah.
Kiss some butt,
but, but, uh,
