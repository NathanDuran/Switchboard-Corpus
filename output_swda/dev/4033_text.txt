So how do you get most of your current event information?
Well, , see I'm going to school right now,
and, uh,  while I'm working, I don't get a, I don't get a chance to read the paper a lot,
Uh-huh.
and I don't watch T V as much really either, because, uh, my free time is kind of,
and I do, like to do other stuff with it.
Right.
While I'm at work sometimes, I, on the computer network um, I read the news sometimes,
Uh-huh.
and that's kind of helpful.
I would imagine going to college, though, your professors and different things,
you keep up on what's going on.
That's true,
I mean, my roommates and stuff, you know people around me talk about it.
Yeah.
And the people I work with are pretty, you know, up, up-to-date on that kind of stuff,
so.
Right.
Well, I'm a housewife,
I have three kids,
and so  um, I get most of my information probably through just the news at six o'clock and then, um, talking with people and just hearing what's going on.  .
Uh-huh.
Yeah.
Do you watch,  do you watch the network, like major network news,
or do you watch like  the MACNEIL LEHRER HOUR?
Just the  regular channel  just channel eight.
Oh, really.
That's our channel here
that's the, um, eyewitness news.
Uh-huh.
So.
Oh,  see channel, where I am channel eight's, um, like public T V,
so it's kind of different.
Oh, uh-huh.
Yeah.
I think,  I think the, uh,
I think a lot of the commentators on, like the major networks, like right, it's kind of appropriate right now because of the election stuff going on,
but, um, it seems that, um, they kind of get to throw their opinions into how they, you know, report on the news.
Right.
And I think even in the elections, they choose who they're going to follow and who they're not,
and basically you know, if a candidate can get them to follow, then the news will, you know, kind of publicize his name.
Yeah.
Yeah,
exactly.
I don't think that the way I get the news is the right way to get it.
I think you get a very lopsided picture of what's going on.
Uh-huh,
because they can, they can only report on, I mean,
they give each candidate perhaps, you know, ten second blurbs in which to, you know, to say, you, you just can't get a full picture of, you know their message unless you have time to sit down and and probably read something on it.
Right.
Right.
And the news, too, it just doesn't, um, cover that many stories,
I mean, it just covers your basic, you know, violent crimes and, you know, and, and your catastrophes with weather and stuff,
Yeah.
but other than that, you really don't know what's going on.
Yeah.
Um, I will read our current letters that come out on elections
and, I guess I do read that,
and I do study who's running in our area,
and I do study what's going on in the economy.
It, you know,
and, I guess I do read other magazines, um, too, to get my information.
What kind of, see,
I subscribe to like SCIENCE NEWS,
and that's, that's real good because it gives like a brief summary of, or like the updates, like of what's going on in science without getting into a lot of detail that would, you know, bog me down that I wouldn't know about
Right.
but other than that I don't really read,
I don't, I don't really subscribe to anything else.
I used to read every month a READER'S DIGEST
Uh-huh.
but, um, now I guess I just have friends that clip articles
or if I, you know, am interested in something, of course, during the when we were in war, I read up on that just a little in the newspaper to find out what was going on.
Oh, yeah.
But a lot of the times, I, you know, I wish I had the time to read all the stories in the newspaper,
but I just can't seem to find the time.
Yeah.
If they put it out in a video, or on not a video but a cassette tape or something, where you could just listen to it I would do that while I was doing other things.
Yeah.
But,
Well, I remember back during the, uh, during the war, everyone here at work always had the radio or the T V on, because that, they were going constantly with that stuff.
Right.
But, uh.
Well, I, um, they even did a story on our news here in Texas on what people wanted to see more of,
and people said that they wanted to see more on outside of Texas news.
You know, we just don't want to hear every night all the killings that went on here in Dallas
Yeah.
that we want to hear what's going on with the economy, what's being done to help it, what's going on in other countries, what's, you know, just  more information.
If they reported every,  if they reported every violent crime in Atlanta it would take, it would probably take the whole news hour
Yeah.
But, uh.
Well, I guess we'll get pretty good news coverage in a couple of years when you host the, uh, summer olympics
Oh, yeah,
that's,
they start, already they're having like, um,
in the newspaper they have a section, I think, every now and then, on the Olympics, you know,
and they've got like a countdown,
it's like sixteen hundred days or something.
I know, we're trying to get tickets to it right now.
Oh, really?
Yeah.
That's going to be crazy that time of year here.
But, uh.
Yeah.
I can't believe, I mean,
they're, they're stretching out the Olympic news for that much coverage over,
I guess people want to hear about it.
Also big in the news right now is the Braves, because they're, uh, they're in, you know, spring training or whatever
Right,
right.
and they did so well last year.
Yeah,
they spent a lot of time, that's another thing, they spend a long time on sports,
and I think that, um, that's fine, I would like to see more time spent on other things.
Yeah.
But.
It seems like,
I don't know,
they way they do the newscasts, I wish they, they kind of separated it, you know,
if you wanted to watch one thing you could turn to some channel for it
but I don't have cable.
