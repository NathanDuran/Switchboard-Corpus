Um, what kind of hobbies do you have?
Um, I do a lot of cross-stitching and painting, when I do have spare time.
Really,
I like cross-stitch too.
Oh, I love it.
I just have a hard time finding any spare time lately.
That's my case also.
I've got a new born
and there's just no time.
Uh-huh.
Have you been cross-stitching long?
Oh, several years.
My husband is even interested in it now.
He likes to help me design, um, you know, projects that are, a little more customized.
Oh, really.
Mine, sort of, he looks at the pattern
and he says how do you get that from there to the material
Not that hard.
Oh, it's not.
I really enjoy it.
Uh-huh.
I do a lot of my own patterns also.
Yeah.
In fact, I did one, BILL THE CAT, you know, from Glenn County that, uh, was a real good one to do.
Oh, yeah.
It was tough,
but, uh, yeah.
Do you have any others,
or is this mainly cross-stitching?
Um, I do mostly that, um,
not very artistic really for like painting and stuff.
Oh, uh-huh.
Um, Yeah.
But, now I don't know.
I'm still trying to get all the D M C colors
Oh, really
Yeah,
I've got the kits to put them all in.
I don't have them all yet certainly.
Yeah,
right.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I got to counting the other day
and, uh, I think I have, what was it two hundred,
and I got to thinking the money that I've got invested in this is, uh,
it, yeah, it can add up quick.
Oh, yeah.
I just, I just keep an inventory of what I currently have,
and then when I start a new project, I go through and see if I, if I, you know,
just buy the colors that I need of what I'm low on.
Uh-huh.
Right.
I see.
Well, now can I improvise with adding and using another color instead, you know, what comes close. Because a lot of them are similar.
Uh-huh.
Yeah.
A lot of times you can do that.
I think, I
the pinks, there's like forty-two different shades of pink.
Good grief
Yeah,
there's lots of  pinks and greens.
Pinks and greens.
Yeah.
There's lots of shades of greens.
But the colors,
I just love all the different colors.
Yeah.
They had quite a few new ones come out last year, that they added to.
But, you don't have much spare time either?
Well, not lately
I just started a new job and trying to get acclimated there.
Oh, yes.
And that does take some time.
And if we're trying to get acclimated with the, uh, with having a baby,
and .
Yeah.
How old?
He's seven months old.
Oh, yeah.
And just into everything,
so there's not a spare moment.
Oh, but I wouldn't trade it for the world.
I've been trying to do some bibs for him. And, uh, work on his Christmas stocking.
Oh, yeah.
Yeah.
We missed it last year,
so hopefully this year he'll have one.
Yeah.
Well, last year he was a little bit young for having one.
Right.
He wouldn't have enjoyed it anyway
You would have
but,
Right.
If it tasted good, yeah.
All he liked was the lights this year,
so.
Oh, yeah.
Oh, well, that's neat that you like cross-stitching also.
Yeah,
that's, that's kind of strange that we got the same call.
Yeah.
It's a call.
Oh, I'm sorry.
Go ahead.
No,
that's okay.
Okay uh,
but, yeah,
I've been doing it for probably ten years or so.
Oh, wow.
No,
I just started about, well, five years ago, I think.
But it is peaceful,
I mean it is relaxing to do, once you find the time to do it.
Uh-huh
There's also a couple of large projects, baby afghans,
and I got one done
and I think the other one is going. The child is going to be in high school before I get finished.
On that, uh
Bear thing .
is it one of those afghans that I've seen in the packages with the, with the large squares?
Well, yeah
I just, I bought the cloth and the pattern for it.
I didn't, um, I didn't buy the, uh, I didn't buy a kit.
Oh, uh-huh.
Well I've seen the afghans in the stores that are designed for cross-stitching.
Uh-huh.
It's that cloth.
Oh, okay.
It's cloth I think.
Uh-huh.
And it has the borders and everything already.
Yeah.
Those are pretty.
Number one turned out just great,
and the lady said she couldn't believe that they know that I had done it in the colors, that they had decorated the nursery
and I didn't even know it.
Oh, that's a .
I gave it to her
and she said how did you know those are the colors we used.
I said didn't
That was a good .
It worked out that way.
That's great.
Uh, that, uh,
now I've got the material to do an afghan that I just never did get around to finishing it.
Uh-huh.
I like those.
Those are pretty.
Yeah.
Lilly, Lilly , she said, she said it's for your daughter to use.
Oh, no.
She said, I know she doesn't get to touch it.
She hung it on the wall.
Yes,
my, uh, grandmother, um, made us a couple of quilts for the baby,
and I was like, oh, I don't want to mess those up.
Yeah
Uh, they're just too nice.
I mean you don't get many hand made quilts anymore.
Yeah.
Oh, yeah.
True.
Well, I've enjoyed this.
Okay.
But, uh, well keep up the good, um,
keep up the cross-stitching.
You too.
All right,
thanks.
Uh-huh,
bye bye.
Bye bye.
